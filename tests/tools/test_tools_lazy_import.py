"""Behavior tests for the ``strands_robots.tools`` lazy-import contract.

The tools package defers importing each tool module until first attribute
access so that ``import strands_robots.tools`` never pulls in numpy, pyserial,
psutil, and the other heavy per-tool dependencies. These tests pin that public
contract:

- Every name advertised in ``__all__`` is lazily importable as a real attribute.
- The first access materializes the tool via ``__getattr__`` and caches it into
  the package namespace, so a repeat access returns the identical object.
- An unknown attribute raises ``AttributeError`` naming the package and the
  missing attribute, matching the standard module-level ``__getattr__`` protocol.
