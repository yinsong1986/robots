"""A recorded action column holds a command that was issued, or the frame is refused.

``DatasetRecorder.add_frame`` writes one value per declared action column. When
the frame's action dict does not carry a declared column, there is no command to
record, and every candidate placeholder misrepresents what happened:

* ``0.0`` is itself a command on an absolute-position action space, so
  :meth:`replay_episode` drives that joint to zero at servo speed.
* A joint's measured position is in different units from a normalized or
  tendon-driven actuator's command.
* The command standing on the actuator cannot be read back - the
  action-to-``ctrl`` map is deliberately not injective.

So the frame is refused. These tests pin the refusal, the scoping that keeps a
shared-scene recording working, and that no episode survives a refused rollout
for :meth:`replay_episode` to re-issue.
