# Recording & datasets

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

sim = Robot("so100")
sim.start_recording(repo_id="user/my_dataset", task="pick up the cube", fps=50)
sim.run_policy(robot_name="so100", instruction="pick up the cube",
               policy_provider="mock", duration=10.0)
sim.stop_recording()
# LeRobot v3 dataset written to $HF_LEROBOT_HOME/user/my_dataset
```

`start_recording` requires `[lerobot]`. Without it, use `start_cameras_recording` for plain MP4.

## `fps` must equal the rollout's `control_frequency`

The recorder captures **one frame per control step and never decimates**, so the
rate frames arrive at is the rollout's `control_frequency` - and LeRobot derives
every timestamp from the dataset's declared `fps` positionally
(`timestamp = frame_index / fps`). A differing `fps` therefore cannot be
honored, only mislabelled, so it is refused:

```python
sim.start_recording(repo_id="user/my_dataset", task="t", fps=30)
sim.run_policy(robot_name="so100", policy_provider="mock")   # default 50.0 Hz
# -> "run_policy: the active recording declares 30 fps but this rollout captures
#     at control_frequency=50 Hz. [...] a 1.667x distortion of the episode
#     duration [...] Align the two rates: pass control_frequency=30 to
#     run_policy(), or record at the rollout's rate"
```

The refusal lands before any frame is written, so nothing is lost - pass either
rate. It matters beyond the label: that per-frame interval is the control period
a policy trains on, and `replay_episode` derives its per-frame physics budget
from the dataset rate, so a mislabelled episode also replays at the wrong speed.
To record at a lower rate than you control at, run the rollout at that rate -
there is no decimating recorder.

`PolicyRunner` is drivable directly, and the engine's check is not on that path,
so `PolicyRunner.run` / `PolicyRunner.evaluate` apply the same rule themselves.
They raise `ValueError` rather than returning an error dict, because a direct
caller has no tool envelope to read:

```python
runner = PolicyRunner(sim)
runner.run("so100", policy, control_frequency=50.0, on_frame=hook)
# -> ValueError: PolicyRunner.run: the active recording declares 30 fps but this
#    rollout captures at control_frequency=50 Hz. [...] pass control_frequency=30
#    to PolicyRunner.run()
```

The rule holds whichever call comes first. `start_policy` returns while its
rollout keeps running, so a recording can be opened against a rollout already in
flight - and on the defaults (`fps=30` against `control_frequency=50.0`) that
recorded a 1.667x mislabelled episode with every call reporting success.
`start_recording` refuses the same disagreement, before creating the dataset:

```python
sim.start_policy(robot_name="so100", policy_provider="mock")   # default 50.0 Hz
sim.start_recording(repo_id="user/my_dataset", task="t", fps=30)
# -> "start_recording: this recording would declare 30 fps but a rollout is
#     already running ('so100' at 50 Hz). [...] Align the two rates: record at
#     the rollout's rate (start_recording(fps=50)), or restart the rollout at the
#     recording's rate (stop_policy(robot_name='so100'), then
#     start_policy(..., control_frequency=30))"
```

Rollouts running at *different* rates are refused outright, even when `fps`
matches one of them: their frames interleave into one episode whose single
declared rate cannot describe both, so there is no `fps` to pass instead. Stop
all but one, or restart them at a common `control_frequency`.

The `run_policy` tool owns both rates at once - it takes `dataset_fps` and
`control_frequency` as its own arguments and drives the whole
`start_recording` -> rollout -> `stop_recording` cycle - so it settles the pair
up front, before it opens anything. That matters because it opens its recording
with `overwrite=True`: left to the per-episode rollout, the disagreement was
reported only after any dataset already at `dataset_root` had been replaced with
an empty one, and after every episode had failed with the same message.

```python
run_policy(simulation=sim, robot_name="so100", n_episodes=2,
           control_frequency=50.0, dataset_fps=30,      # cannot both hold
           dataset_root="/tmp/my_dataset")
# -> "run_policy: this call would open a recording declaring 30 fps for a
#     rollout capturing at control_frequency=50 Hz. [...] Align the two rates:
#     pass control_frequency=30, or record at the rollout's rate
#     (dataset_fps=50)."
# The dataset already at /tmp/my_dataset is untouched.
```

`dataset_fps` is ignored when `dataset_root` is omitted (the recording-less
smoke-test mode), so a rollout with no recording runs at any rate.

## Selecting which cameras to record

By default every camera in the scene is recorded into the dataset - including
the implicit `default` free camera that exists even before you call
`add_camera`. A policy that declares a fixed set of image features (e.g. SmolVLA
expects exactly `observation.images.camera1/camera2/camera3`) then trains
against a dataset that carries a stray `observation.images.default` view it
never asked for, and the extra MP4 stream bloats every episode.

Pass `cameras=` to record exactly the views the policy expects:

```python
sim.add_camera(name="camera1", ...)
sim.add_camera(name="camera2", ...)
sim.add_camera(name="camera3", ...)
sim.start_recording(
    repo_id="user/my_dataset", task="pick up the cube", fps=50,
    cameras=["camera1", "camera2", "camera3"],   # drops the implicit 'default'
)
```

The dataset schema then declares only those three image features. Names may be
given in raw MuJoCo form (`arm0/wrist_cam`) or schema-safe form
(`arm0__wrist_cam`); an unknown name fails loudly and lists the available
cameras rather than silently recording the wrong set. The names are checked
before any dataset is created, resumed or wiped, so a typo costs nothing even
under `overwrite=True`. Omit `cameras=` to keep
the legacy behavior of recording every camera - in that case a one-time
warning is logged when the implicit `default` overview camera is swept in
alongside your real sensor cameras, so the stray view is never recorded
silently.

A robot's own cameras are offered under two names: the short name from its
MJCF (`wrist`) and the namespaced name the compiled scene uses
(`arm0/wrist`). Both address the same physical camera and record the same
frames, so pick one per dataset - listing both records the same view twice
under two columns. Every camera key carries the view of the camera it names:
a key the scene can no longer render (for example after `replace_scene_mjcf`,
which swaps the compiled scene but leaves the camera registry untouched) is
absent from the observation rather than filled in with the
overview, so a column is never quietly populated from the wrong camera.

Renaming means picking a name `add_camera` accepts, and that alphabet is not
free: the name is also the key the camera's frames travel under - the mesh
publishes each frame on `strands/<peer_id>/camera/<name>`, the IoT offload joins
it into the S3 object key, and a recording writes it as
`observation.images.<name>`. So a camera name is a bare token of letters, digits,
`_` or `-` opening on a letter or a digit, optionally scoped to one robot as
`<robot>/<camera>` - `wrist`, `front_cam`, `cam-2`, `arm0/wrist_cam`. One scope
level and no more, because that is the namespace `add_robot` gives what it spawns
and the one the mesh strips before publishing. Anything else (`a b`, `wrist.rgb`,
`*`, `..`, `sub/../etc`, `a//b`) is refused at `add_camera` rather than
registered and then misrouted, dropped, or written under a key that addresses
another camera.

That guarantee needs the scene's cameras to have distinct column names, and the
`/` -> `__` collapse is not injective: `arm0/wrist` and `arm0__wrist` are two
cameras and one column. `start_recording` refuses such a scene up front, naming
both cameras and the key they share, before any dataset is created, resumed or
wiped - rename one of them (`add_camera(name=...)`) so the names still differ
once `/` becomes `__`. Scoping with `cameras=` is not a way around it: whichever
of the pair won the column, the column would be named after the other one, and
if the two render at different sizes the first frame is rejected and the episode
is lost.

`cameras=` is a list of **distinct** camera names, and every surface that accepts
one - `start_recording`, `render_all`, and the plain-MP4
`start_cameras_recording` / `start_cameras_recording_synchronous` - enforces that
shape up front. Two mistakes are refused rather than guessed at, because neither
can be honored as written:

- **A single name passed as a bare string.** `cameras="wrist"` is iterable per
  character, so it would be read as five cameras, one per letter. Wrap it in a
  list: `cameras=["wrist"]`.
- **A repeated name.** `cameras=["wrist", "wrist"]` cannot mean one camera and
  cannot mean two. In a dataset schema it collapses to a single column, so the
  recording declares fewer views than were asked for; in `render_all` it renders
  the same view twice; and in a plain-MP4 recording it opens a second encoder on
  the one output path, so the camera is rendered and appended twice per capture
  tick and the artifact ledger reports two files where one exists.

A `Mapping` is refused for the same reason - it is iterable over its keys, so its
values would be silently discarded. `cameras=None` keeps its "every camera"
meaning.


### Where the dataset is written (`root` / `overwrite`)

`root` is the on-disk directory for the dataset, used verbatim. When omitted,
the directory is derived from `repo_id`: an `owner/name` id records into
`$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/{repo_id}` (default `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot`), and a
`repo_id` that is itself a path is taken as the directory. The home is read from
LeRobot's own `HF_LEROBOT_HOME` constant, so exporting it moves both the
recording and where `LeRobotDataset` later reads it back from -
`resolve_dataset_dir` is the one owner of those rules and every backend's
`start_recording` applies it.

Being the one owner is what makes `overwrite` mean something: the resolved
directory is forwarded to `LeRobotDataset.create` as an explicit `root`, so the
directory inspected (and, under `overwrite=True`, deleted) before the write is
the directory the dataset is then written into. LeRobot derives an absent root
as `$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/{repo_id}` for any id, so letting it derive one of its own
would part company with the rule above for exactly the path-like ids.

`DatasetRecorder.resume` - the append entry point - forwards the same resolved
directory, so the `repo_id` that created a dataset reopens it. LeRobot refuses an
absent `root` there outright, because the directory it would derive for a writer
is the revision-safe Hub snapshot cache; resolving here is what keeps the append
reachable on the same arguments the recording was made with.

Reading back applies the same rule, so a path-like `repo_id` replays, streams
and transforms the directory it recorded to with no `root` restated. Only that
rule is applied on the read side: an `owner/name` id keeps its absent root so
LeRobot resolves its own revision-safe snapshot cache for a download - which is
already the directory a local recording under that id wrote to.

Passing an existing **empty** directory - for example one returned by
`tempfile.mkdtemp()` - is accepted and recorded into:

```python
import tempfile
root = tempfile.mkdtemp()                       # existing empty dir
sim.start_recording(repo_id="user/my_dataset", root=root, fps=30)   # records here
```

When `root` already contains a LeRobotDataset (a `meta/` directory),
`start_recording` **resumes** it and appends new episodes unless
`overwrite=True`, which wipes and recreates it. A `root` that exists, is not a
LeRobotDataset, and is **not empty** is left untouched and reported as an error
rather than clobbered - pass `overwrite=True` or choose a new/empty `root`.

Because `overwrite=True` is the one posture that deletes a dataset without
asking, it is applied as the last step before the recorder is built: every
refusal `start_recording` can make - the fps and camera domains, the boolean
postures, an unknown camera name, a scene whose camera names collide - happens
first, so a refused call leaves the dataset that was already there untouched.

`overwrite` and `push_to_hub` select a **posture**, so both must be booleans and
are checked before anything is created, resumed, wiped or published. Neither is
read by truthiness: every non-empty string is truthy, so `overwrite="false"` -
the spelling an operator reaches for when opting out - used to reach the wipe
branch and delete the dataset it was meant to append to, and
`push_to_hub="false"` used to publish it at `stop_recording`. Both now report the
flag instead:

```python
sim.start_recording(repo_id="user/my_dataset", root=root, fps=30, overwrite="false")
# -> error: "start_recording: overwrite must be a boolean, got 'false'. ..."
```

A resume inherits the existing dataset's schema, so `fps` must match the rate it
was created at - a resume cannot change it. Requesting a different rate is
refused, naming the on-disk value, rather than appending frames timestamped on
the dataset's timebase instead of the one they were captured at:

```python
sim.start_recording(repo_id="user/my_dataset", root=root, fps=60)  # dataset is 30 fps
# -> error: "dataset fps differs: on-disk=30 vs requested=60
#            (a resumed dataset keeps its on-disk rate; pass fps=30 to append at it)"
```

Pass `fps=30` to append at the dataset's rate, or `overwrite=True` to record a
fresh dataset at 60.

When you drive recording through the `run_policy` tool (which owns the
`start_recording` -> rollout -> `stop_recording` cycle), forward the same
subset with `dataset_cameras=`:

```python
from strands_robots.tools.run_policy import run_policy

run_policy(
    simulation=sim,
    robot_name="so101",
    policy_provider="lerobot_local",
    instruction="pick up the cube",
    n_episodes=1,
    dataset_root="/tmp/my_dataset",
    dataset_cameras=["camera1", "camera2", "camera3"],  # drops the implicit 'default'
)
```

When set, `dataset_cameras` is forwarded as `start_recording(cameras=...)`,
which both the MuJoCo and Newton backends support, so the subset is applied
identically on either engine. Omit it (the default `None`) to record every
scene camera - the default path forwards no `cameras` kwarg at all.

To also capture a rollout MP4 (the visual artifact for review or VLM
defect-checking), pass the same `video={...}` config the
`Simulation.run_policy` facade accepts - the tool forwards it per episode:

```python
run_policy(
    simulation=sim,
    robot_name="so101",
    policy_provider="lerobot_local",
    instruction="pick up the cube",
    n_episodes=3,
    dataset_root="/tmp/my_dataset",
    video={"path": "/tmp/rollout.mp4", "fps": 30, "camera": "camera1",
           "width": 640, "height": 480},
)
```

`video["path"]` is required to enable recording; a falsy/absent path disables
it. Only the keys above are accepted: any other key (`filename`, `resolution`,
...) is rejected with an error listing the accepted set, so a mistyped option
cannot silently produce a rollout with no video or a video at the wrong
resolution. For `n_episodes > 1` an `_ep{i}` suffix is inserted before the extension
(`/tmp/rollout_ep0.mp4`, `_ep1`, ...) so episodes do not overwrite one another -
matching the facade's own multi-episode naming. The returned `{"json": {...}}`
block carries `video_paths`, the list of MP4s that actually landed on disk
(only existing files are reported, never the requested paths).

## Multi-episode recording

A recording session is one dataset. The simplest way to collect N episodes in
one session is `run_policy(n_episodes=N)` - it runs N rollouts back-to-back,
flushes a dataset episode boundary after each, and resets the sim between
episodes for you:

```python
sim.start_recording(repo_id="user/my_dataset", task="pick up the cube", fps=50)
sim.run_policy(robot_name="so100", instruction="pick up the cube",
               policy_provider="mock", n_steps=60, n_episodes=20)
sim.stop_recording()
# -> 20 episodes, each with its own episode_index / length / from_index / to_index
```

`n_steps` (or `duration`) is the per-episode horizon. `reset_between=False`
chains episodes from the previous end state instead of resetting. When a `seed`
is given it is offset per episode (`seed + i`) for reproducible-yet-distinct
rollouts, and a `video={...}` config is written per episode to a path with
`_ep{i}` inserted before the extension so episodes do not overwrite one another.
The aggregate result carries `n_episodes_completed`, `episodes_saved`,
`total_steps`, and a per-episode list in its `{"json": {...}}` block.

If you need full control over each rollout (different instructions, custom
randomization, conditional logic between episodes), drive the loop yourself and
call `save_episode()` after each rollout to flush it as its own episode:

```python
sim.start_recording(repo_id="user/my_dataset", task="pick up the cube", fps=50)
for _ in range(20):
    sim.reset()
    sim.run_policy(robot_name="so100", instruction="pick up the cube",
                   policy_provider="mock", n_steps=60)
    sim.save_episode()        # flush this rollout as one episode
sim.stop_recording()          # flushes any trailing rollout automatically
```

`save_episode` is idempotent on an empty buffer, so it is safe to call
unconditionally inside a loop. LeRobot computes `stats.json` per episode and then
aggregates, so per-rollout boundaries keep dataset statistics correct across the
`reset()` teleport between rollouts.

`reset()` is itself an episode boundary during a recording: if frames are
buffered when you call it, `reset()` flushes them as their own episode before
re-initializing the world (it reports the saved episode in its result text).
This means a bare `run_policy` + `reset` collection loop already produces one
episode per rollout - the explicit `save_episode()` is optional when you reset
between rollouts:

```python
sim.start_recording(repo_id="user/my_dataset", task="pick up the cube", fps=50)
for _ in range(20):
    sim.run_policy(robot_name="so100", instruction="pick up the cube",
                   policy_provider="mock", n_steps=60)
    sim.reset()               # flushes this rollout as one episode, then resets
sim.stop_recording()          # flushes any trailing rollout automatically
# -> 20 episodes
```

Without `n_episodes`, an explicit `save_episode()`, or a `reset()` between rollouts, all
20 rollouts append to the same buffer and `stop_recording` flushes them as a
single `episode_index=0` (1200 steps in one episode). To DISCARD a partial
rollout instead of flushing it on the next `reset()`, call
`clear_episode_buffer()` first.

Every backend cuts the boundary: `reset()` asks one shared rule, so the loop
above yields 20 episodes on MuJoCo, Newton and Isaac alike. The one exception is
a *partial* Isaac reset - `reset(env_ids=[...])` re-initializes only the named
environments, and whether the recorded robot's rollout ended is not knowable
from `env_ids`, so no boundary is cut and the buffer stays open. Call
`save_episode()` yourself if a partial reset does end the episode you are
recording.

## Verifying episode count

An LLM agent narrating "20 episodes recorded" is not proof: a single
`run_policy(n_episodes=1)` (or 20 looped tool calls into one open buffer)
produces one merged `episode_index=0` mega-episode while the agent believes it
recorded 20. Never trust agent narration for dataset structure - verify against
the on-disk metadata. After `stop_recording`, call `verify_dataset_episodes`:

```python
sim.stop_recording()
result = sim.verify_dataset_episodes(expected=20)
assert result["status"] == "success"   # else MISMATCH, fail loud
```

It checks two independent sources of truth and requires them to AGREE:

* the parquet under `meta/episodes/**/*.parquet` (the distinct `episode_index`
  set - the ground truth), and
* the `total_episodes` header in `meta/info.json`.

`status` is `"error"` when the parquet count differs from `expected` OR when the
parquet disagrees with `info.json` (an internally inconsistent dataset, e.g. an
interrupted finalize - `sources_agree` is then `False`), so a dataset that
happens to match `expected` on one source but not the other still fails. The
`{"json": {...}}` block carries `expected`, `actual`, `info_total_episodes`,
`info_problems`, `sources_agree`, `episode_indices`, and `total_frames` for
programmatic CI gating. The pure-pyarrow `read_dataset_episode_indices(root)`
exposes the same facts without instantiating a `LeRobotDataset`.

A header that is present but is not a count at all - `2.5`, `"2"`, `true`, or a
JSON number outside double range such as `1e400` (which `json.load` parses to
`inf`) - is a THIRD outcome, distinct from both a matching count and an absent
header: `info_total_episodes` is `None`, the reason lands in `info_problems`, and
`sources_agree` is `False`. Such a header is never coerced to a nearby number,
because `int(2.5)` is `2` - exactly the count a two-episode parquet holds, so
coercing it would certify the inconsistent dataset. Every reader of that header
(this facade, `verify-dataset`, `read_dataset_episode_indices`, and the
training-side validation split) shares one domain,
`strands_robots.utils.declared_count`, so one file cannot get two verdicts.

The same check runs from the shell against any LeRobot dataset on disk, with an
exit code suitable for CI:

```bash
strands-robots verify-dataset /path/to/dataset --expected 20   # exit 0 pass, 1 fail
strands-robots verify-dataset /path/to/dataset --json          # machine-readable report
strands-robots verify-dataset /path/to/dataset --no-check-videos  # skip the per-episode MP4 checks
```

`verify-dataset` reuses the same pure-pyarrow `read_dataset_episode_indices`
helper (no `lerobot` import) and flags five failure modes: the mega-episode
(fewer distinct episodes than `--expected`), `meta/info.json` `total_episodes` /
`total_frames` drifting from the parquet ground truth - or declaring something
that is not a count at all - (caught even without `--expected`), any episode below `--min-frames` (default 1), - unless
`--no-check-videos` is passed - any per-episode video file that is missing or
empty on disk, and - unless `--no-check-stats` is passed - a dead control
column. The video check is the video-modality sibling of the
mega-episode class: a dataset can carry the right episode count yet have no
pixels because the recorder's video encoder failed or the MP4 streams were
never written. It resolves each camera's MP4 from `meta/info.json`'s
`video_path` template and the episode parquet's `videos/<key>/chunk_index` /
`file_index` columns, and reports the count it checked in
`video_files_checked`. The programmatic form is
`strands_robots.verify_dataset.verify_dataset(root, expected=None, min_frames=1, check_videos=True, check_stats=True)`,
which returns the same report dict.

The dead-control-column check is the proprioceptive sibling: correct counts and
pixels, but the `action` (or `observation.state`) column was written as all
zeros because the writer's keys never resolved to the declared columns. It reads
the per-episode `min`/`max` stats LeRobot v3 writes inline, so it needs no video
decode and no `data/` scan.

A multi-robot recording is graded one level finer, per robot. `start_recording`
gives every robot its own state/action columns and namespaces each declared name
with the robot's instance name (`alice__shoulder_pan`), so a resolution failure
that affects one robot alone leaves that robot's whole block of columns zero
while the other robot's columns carry real measurements. The vector as a whole
therefore still varies, and a whole-vector test reports `[PASS]`. The check
splits the vector into the per-robot blocks `meta/info.json` declares and flags
any block that is wholly zero, naming the robot:

```
feature 'observation.state' is identically zero for every 'bob' column across
episode 0 (20 frame(s)) - dead control column block
```

A zero *subset* of one robot's block is left alone - a gripper parked at zero for
a whole episode is a measurement, not a writer fault - and a dataset that
declares no column names is graded by the whole-vector rule exactly as before.

`--expected` and `--min-frames` are both non-negative integers, and each has a
meaningful `0`: `--expected 0` asks that a dataset be empty, and `--min-frames 0`
skips the per-episode length check (useful when the writer omits the `length`
column). Anything else - a negative threshold, a fraction, a non-finite value -
is reported as a problem and exits non-zero, rather than being applied. That
matters for `--min-frames` specifically: the length check runs only when the
threshold is above zero, so a value that is not a usable count would otherwise
switch the check off and certify a dataset holding a zero-length episode. The
same domain backs `verify_dataset_episodes(expected=...)`, so neither surface
accepts an episode count the other refuses.

The dataset can switch that check off the same way the threshold could: the
length check runs only when the parquet carries per-episode lengths at all, and
availability is whether a `length` was *read*, not whether one was positive. A
run that wrote three episodes of zero frames is graded and named
(`3 episode(s) below min_frames=1`), and its `meta/info.json total_frames` is
still compared against the zero the parquet holds - previously the whole-run
corruption read as "this writer omits the `length` column" and passed while the
strictly better `[5, 0, 0]` failed. A column that is absent, or present but
wholly null, remains unavailable: a length nobody recorded is unknown, not zero,
so neither gains a zero-length verdict.

`verify-dataset` always produces a report - it never crashes on the corruption
it exists to flag. A corrupt or foreign `meta/episodes` parquet, a non-v3
`video_path` template, or a truncated / unreadable MP4 is reported as a problem
string in the report (and a non-zero exit code), not surfaced as a raw
traceback.

Corruption confined to SOME episode parquet shards (the usual outcome of an
interrupted rsync or hub download) is localised rather than fatal: each
unreadable shard is named as a problem, the readable shards still supply
`total_episodes` / `frames_per_episode`, and the info.json, video, and
dead-column checks still run against them. Only a `meta/episodes` tree with no
readable shard at all reports zero episodes. The same holds for
`verify_dataset_episodes`, which additionally refuses to certify a dataset with
unreadable shards even when the readable count matches `expected` - the count is
then only a lower bound, reported in the `unreadable_files` diagnostics.

## Recording paths

| Method | Extra needed | Output |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `start_recording` / `stop_recording` | `[lerobot]` | LeRobot v3 (parquet + MP4) |
| `save_episode` | `[lerobot]` | Close current rollout as one episode (call once per `run_policy` for N episodes) |
| `start_cameras_recording` / `stop_cameras_recording` | `[sim-mujoco]` alone | Plain MP4, no parquet |

`stop_cameras_recording` returns a verdict, not just a report. Two things stop
it finishing, and both answer the same way: a structured **error** carrying
`stopped: False` and the per-camera buffered frame counts, no MP4 written, and
the recording left registered so a later call can still encode it.

The first is a join that expires. The daemon recorder runs in its own thread, so
the stop asks that loop to exit and waits 5 s for it; if the loop is still inside
`render` when the budget runs out -- a wedged GL context, an EGL device that
stopped answering -- reading a buffer it may still append to is refused rather
than encoded.

The second is a flush with no encoder to call. `imageio` comes with
`[sim-mujoco]`, but `[sim-newton]` and `[cosmos3-sim]` bring `mujoco` without
it, and neither start verb probes the encoder, so the flush is the first call
that needs one. It reports before opening any writer, so every buffer is intact
and installing the encoder and calling again writes them.

"No encoder" covers two modules, not one: `imageio` declares the plugin that
actually writes MP4 -- `imageio_ffmpeg` -- as an optional extra of its own, so an
install can have `imageio` and still no MP4 writer. The flush requires both, and quotes whichever is missing, so
the remedy it prints is the one that works:

```
'imageio_ffmpeg' is required for MP4 video encoding (encode_clip)
Install with:
  pip install 'strands-robots[sim-mujoco]'
  pip install imageio-ffmpeg
```

```python
result = sim.stop_cameras_recording()
if result["status"] == "error":
    # Nothing was encoded -- either the loop is still capturing (an MP4 read
    # from a buffer that is still growing would not describe either frame list)
    # or there is no encoder installed. Either way the frames are still there
    # and the recording is still registered, so calling again flushes them.
    result = sim.stop_cameras_recording()
```

Only a flush deregisters a recording, so being registered is exactly what "holds
frames nobody has encoded" means -- and that is what both start verbs check.
`start_cameras_recording` and `start_cameras_recording_synchronous` refuse a new
recording for as long as the old one is registered, whether or not its thread is
still alive: while it is, starting would put a second thread on the same cameras,
and once it has exited, starting would silently discard the frames the failed
stop just promised were recoverable. Retrying the stop is the remedy in both
cases, and on a recording whose loop has exited it joins immediately and encodes.

That registration is published before the capture thread is started, so the check
also covers two starts racing each other: there is no window in which a thread is
capturing while `get_cameras_recording_status` answers `[idle]` and
`stop_cameras_recording` reports "Was not recording cameras" as a success. If the
capture thread cannot be started at all, the recording is deregistered again and
`start_cameras_recording` returns a structured error naming it, rather than
leaving behind a registration that only a flush could clear.

`get_cameras_recording_status` reports which of the four phases holds, in its
text and as `phase` in its JSON block:

| `phase` | `running` | `thread_alive` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recording` | `True` | `True` | Capturing normally. |
| `stopping` | `False` | `True` | A stop's join expired; frames can still land. |
| `unflushed` | `False` | `False` | The loop has exited, frames still unencoded -- stop again to flush. |
| `idle` | - | - | Nothing registered; there is no buffer left to encode. |

`[idle]` is therefore a promise that nothing is pending, which is why the
settled-but-registered state gets its own name instead of borrowing it.

The Isaac backend exposes the same pair. It captures through the `on_frame` hook
`start_cameras_recording` returns rather than a daemon thread, so it has no join
to expire and none of the thread-dependent phases above. The encoder-absence rule
is the same one, and both recorders word it from one place
(`encoder_absent_flush_refusal`): nothing is encoded and nothing is dropped, the
refusal carries `stopped: False` with the per-camera buffered counts, the
recording stays registered, and installing the encoder and calling
`stop_cameras_recording` again encodes the frames it kept. A start is refused for
as long as those frames are registered, for the same reason.

`fps`, `width`, `height` and `max_frames_per_camera` on the plain-MP4 recorders
must be positive whole numbers - the same domain `run_policy(video={...})`,
`start_recording(fps=...)` and the shared encoder
`strands_robots.rendering.encode_clip` enforce. An unusable value (`fps=0`, a
negative frame cap) is a structured error naming the parameter rather than a
recording that reports success and writes no file. Omit `width`/`height` to use
each camera's configured resolution.

Encoding frames directly through `encode_clip(frames, path, fps=...)` follows the
same rule and raises `ValueError` for a rate it cannot honor - a fractional or
non-positive `fps` previously produced a clip at some other rate (the GIF writer
clamped it to 1 fps, ffmpeg substituted its own default) or no file at all, with
the output path still returned. `encode_clip` also raises `RuntimeError` when the
encoder wrote no clip despite accepting the frames, so a returned path always
names a clip that exists.

`encode_clip`'s `quality` is a finite number in `[1, 10]` (higher is better), and
that domain holds for both containers even though only the MP4 writer reads the
value - so one call does not become valid by changing the output extension. The
bound is the encoder's own: `0` is refused despite older documentation offering
`0-10`, and `True` is refused rather than acting as a silent quality of `1`, the
lowest offered. A NumPy real such as `np.int64(8)` is accepted and converted,
since the ffmpeg writer only recognises a plain `int`/`float`. The refusal is a
`ValueError` from `encode_clip` rather than the encoder's own `assert`, so it
does not disappear when Python runs with `-O`:

```python
from strands_robots.rendering import encode_clip

encode_clip(frames, "clip.mp4", fps=30, quality=9)   # a usable quality
encode_clip(frames, "clip.mp4", fps=30, quality=0)   # ValueError: quality must be between 1 and 10
```

## Video codec (H.264 default, AV1 opt-in)

`start_recording` (and `DatasetRecorder.create`/`resume`) default to
`vcodec="h264"`. H.264 is universally decodable - including by OpenCV's
`cv2.VideoCapture`, which is what many downstream VLM video readers use to
*watch* a recorded episode. The recorded per-camera MP4s therefore reopen and
decode everywhere without a transcode step:

```python
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(".../videos/observation.images.base/chunk-000/file-000.mp4")
ok, frame = cap.read()   # H.264: ok is True, frame is a real (H, W, 3) array
```

Pass `vcodec="libsvtav1"` to opt into AV1 for smaller files in
storage-constrained training pipelines. AV1 reads back fine through LeRobot's
own loader (`torchcodec`/`pyav`), but OpenCV wheels commonly lack an AV1 decoder
and silently yield **0 frames** (`VideoCapture.read()` returns `False`
immediately even though the stream has frames) - so avoid AV1 if anything in
your pipeline reads the videos through OpenCV.

The flat `vcodec` value accepts either codec names (`h264`, `hevc`,
`libsvtav1`) or ffmpeg encoder names (`libx264`, `libx265`); it is normalized
to whatever the installed LeRobot version's encoder config expects. An
unsupported codec fails loudly rather than silently reverting to the default.

## DatasetRecorder direct API

```python
from strands_robots.dataset_recorder import DatasetRecorder

recorder = DatasetRecorder.create(
    repo_id="user/my_dataset",
    fps=30,
    robot_type="so100",
    # When recording from a real LeRobot hardware robot pass the schema dicts
    # straight through:
    #   robot_features=robot.observation_features,
    #   action_features=robot.action_features,
    # When recording from a sim Robot (no `observation_features` attr), pass
    # `joint_names=[...]` instead - the recorder builds the schema for you.
    # The names must be the observation's own keys: for the so100 sim these
    # are Rotation, Pitch, Elbow, Wrist_Pitch, Wrist_Roll, Jaw - i.e.
    # `list(sim.get_observation()["so100"].keys())`. A declared name that a
    # frame's observation (or action) does not carry - absent, or present as
    # `None` - makes `add_frame` raise; nothing is recorded as a stand-in 0.0.
    camera_keys=["default"],
    joint_names=["Rotation", "Pitch", "Elbow", "Wrist_Pitch", "Wrist_Roll", "Jaw"],
    task="pick up the red cube",
    # root=None → $HF_LEROBOT_HOME/user/my_dataset
    # vcodec="h264", streaming_encoding=True, image_writer_threads=4
)

for step in control_loop:
    recorder.add_frame(observation, action, task="pick up the red cube")
recorder.save_episode()
recorder.finalize()
recorder.push_to_hub(tags=["so100", "sim"], private=False)
```

Append to existing dataset (requires `lerobot>=0.5.2`):

```python
recorder = DatasetRecorder.resume(repo_id="user/my_dataset", task="pick up the blue cube")
# root=None -> $HF_LEROBOT_HOME/user/my_dataset, the directory create() wrote to
recorder.add_frame(observation, action)
recorder.save_episode()
recorder.finalize()
```

### A failed import names the install that fixes it

`create()` and `resume()` import `lerobot.datasets.lerobot_dataset`, which fails
for four unrelated reasons that need four different instructions - so the
`ImportError` says which one happened, exactly as every backend's
`start_recording` does:

| Cause | What the error says to do |
|-------|---------------------------|
| lerobot itself is absent | `pip install 'strands-robots[lerobot]'` |
| lerobot is installed, but a package its dataset stack needs (`datasets`, `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `av`, `torchcodec`) is not | `pip install 'lerobot[dataset]'` - installing lerobot alone does not pull those in |
| lerobot is installed but does not provide that module (an out-of-range or from-source lerobot) | `pip install 'strands-robots[lerobot]'`, which pins the supported range |
| the import failed with nothing missing (a binary conflict between installed packages) | No install fixes it; reconcile the conflicting packages |

### Schema column names must be distinct

`camera_keys`, `joint_names` and `action_names` each declare the recorded
dataset's **column names**, so each must be a list of distinct, non-blank names.
`create()` refuses anything else before it touches the on-disk target, so a
refused `overwrite=True` call leaves an existing dataset intact:

```python
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", joint_names="gripper")     # ValueError
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", camera_keys=["front", "front"])  # ValueError
```

Both mistakes used to be accepted and only surfaced in the recorded data:

- A single name passed as a **bare string** is iterable per character, so
  `joint_names="gripper"` declared seven columns (`g`, `r`, `i`, `p`, `p`, `e`,
  `r`). `add_frame` reads each declared name out of the observation, and none of
  those names is in it, so every column recorded `0.0` for the whole episode -
  `create()`, `add_frame()`, `save_episode()` and `finalize()` all succeeded.
  Wrap a single name in a list: `joint_names=["gripper"]`.
- A **repeated** name collapses where it keys a dict and doubles where it indexes
  a position. `camera_keys=["front", "front"]` declared one camera column for the
  two the caller asked for; `joint_names=["j1", "j2", "j2"]` recorded `j2` twice
  and the joint the caller meant not at all.

`None` and `[]` still mean "not supplied" - the schema is then derived from
`robot_features` / `action_features`, or from `joint_names` for the action
columns.

### Camera frame shape must be a usable pixel count

`camera_dims` and the `video_width` / `video_height` pair are one quantity in two
spellings: the recorder declares each camera at
`camera_dims.get(camera, (video_height, video_width))`, so the mapping sets the
shape of the cameras it covers and the pair sets the shape of every other one.
Note the order - `camera_dims` is `(height, width)`, the reverse of the pair.

It is a **declaration, not a resize** - the recorder rescales nothing - so
whatever is given goes straight into the LeRobot feature as
`(height, width, 3)` with names `[height, width, channels]` - the layout
lerobot itself records and every published v3 dataset uses.
`create()` refuses a shape it cannot honor, on the same shared domain and in the
same place as the column names above:

```python
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", camera_keys=["image"],
                       camera_dims={"imagee": (240, 320)})   # ValueError: not a declared camera
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", camera_keys=["image"],
                       camera_dims={"image": (240,)})        # ValueError: not a (height, width) pair
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", camera_keys=["image"],
                       video_width=0)                        # ValueError: must be a positive integer
```

Three mistakes used to be accepted, and none was reported near the parameter that
caused it:

- A key `camera_keys` does not declare is **never looked up**, so the camera it
  was meant for silently took the global pair instead. A camera streaming
  240x320 declared as `camera_dims={"imagee": (240, 320)}` against
  `camera_keys=["image"]` was declared `(3, 480, 640)` from the defaults -
  nothing logged, dataset created, and the mismatch surfacing later against
  `add_frame`.
- A component that is **not a positive integer** was written in as given, so the
  schema declared `(3, 480, nan)` or `(3, 480, '640')` and no frame could match
  it. A pixel count is written into `meta/info.json`, so it has to be a true
  `int`: an integral float would be declared as `480.0`, and a NumPy integer is
  not JSON-serializable.
- A value that is **not a two-element sequence** unpacked as a bare `TypeError`,
  and a non-mapping `camera_dims` as a bare `AttributeError` from the lookup.

`camera_dims=None` and `{}` still mean "not supplied" - every camera then takes
the global pair. Passing the shape as a list rather than a tuple is accepted.

### The recording rate must be a usable frame count

`fps` is the rate the dataset is **declared** at - it is written into
`meta/info.json` and every timestamp is derived from it positionally - so
`create()` holds it to the same positive-whole-number domain every backend's
`start_recording(fps=...)` already applies to the rate it forwards here:

```python
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", fps=2.7)    # ValueError: fps must be a positive whole number
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", fps=float("nan"))   # same refusal
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", fps=True)   # refused, not read as 1 fps
```

LeRobot rejects only `fps <= 0`, so everything above used to be accepted by the
direct API and cost the caller the episode without reporting anything: a
fractional `2.7`, a `nan` or an `inf` created the dataset and then saved **zero
frames**, with `create`, `add_frame`, `save_episode` and `finalize` all returning
normally. `fps=True` recorded a 1 fps dataset (an `int` subclass acting as a 1),
and `fps="30"` dead-ended in a bare `TypeError` naming neither the parameter nor
the method.

The rule is the facades' rule by construction - one shared domain, reached from
both - so a rate `start_recording` accepts cannot be refused deeper. A rate that
disagrees with a rollout's `control_frequency` is a separate check that only the
facades can make (see [`fps` must equal the rollout's
`control_frequency`](#fps-must-equal-the-rollouts-control_frequency)); `create()`
judges the rate on its own terms.

### A posture flag must be a boolean

`use_videos`, `streaming_encoding` and `overwrite` select a *branch* rather than
scaling a quantity, so `create()` holds them to the shared boolean domain - the
one every backend's `start_recording` already applies to the `overwrite` it
forwards here, and the one `push_to_hub(private=...)` and `sync_to_bucket()`
apply to their own flags. `resume()` checks the `streaming_encoding` it forwards
on the same domain:

```python
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", overwrite="false")   # ValueError: overwrite must be a boolean
DatasetRecorder.create(repo_id="user/d", use_videos="no")     # same refusal
DatasetRecorder.resume(repo_id="user/d", streaming_encoding=0)  # same refusal
```

Read by truthiness, every non-empty string is truthy, so the spellings a caller
reaches for when opting *out* selected the branch they were opting out of.
`overwrite` is a confirmation gate in front of a delete, so it was the expensive
one: `overwrite="false"` (also `"no"`, `"off"`, `"0"`) removed the existing
dataset - a dataset holding one recorded episode came back holding zero, and
`create()` returned a working recorder throughout. `use_videos="false"` declared
every camera as `dtype="video"` where `False` declares `"image"`, a schema
decision written into `meta/info.json` and fixed for the life of the dataset, and
the same unconverted string then reached LeRobot's own boolean parameter, as
`streaming_encoding="false"` did.

The check runs in the same guard block as the schema and rate checks above -
before the lerobot extra is probed and before the on-disk target is touched - so
a refused flag cannot remove a dataset on the way to being reported.

### Re-recording into an existing `repo_id`

`DatasetRecorder.create()` builds a **fresh** dataset. If the resolved dataset
directory already exists, LeRobot's `create()` would raise a bare
`FileExistsError` (its `mkdir` uses `exist_ok=False`). `create()` resolves this
up front, matching the `start_recording` facade:

- `overwrite=True` wipes the existing directory and creates a fresh dataset.
- `overwrite=False` (default) on an existing dataset (a dir containing `meta/`)
  raises a clear `FileExistsError` naming `overwrite=True` (fresh) and
  `resume()` (append) - not a cryptic LeRobot error, and never a silent clobber.
- An existing **empty** directory (e.g. from `tempfile.mkdtemp()`) is cleared so
  `create()` does not dead-end on its own existence guard.
- A non-empty **non-dataset** directory raises `ValueError` rather than deleting
  unrelated files.
- `overwrite` must be a boolean (see [A posture flag must be a
  boolean](#a-posture-flag-must-be-a-boolean)), checked before the target is
  touched, so a value that is not one cannot delete a dataset.

```python
# Re-run a capture script into the same repo_id, replacing the old dataset:
recorder = DatasetRecorder.create(
    repo_id="user/my_dataset", fps=30, joint_names=[...], overwrite=True,
)
```

Use `resume()` (not `create(overwrite=True)`) when you want to **append**
episodes to the existing dataset instead of replacing it.

### A frame the recorder cannot write fails the rollout

`DatasetRecorder` is fail-fast by default (`strict=True`): if the underlying
`LeRobotDataset` write fails, it raises
`strands_robots.dataset_recorder.RecordingFrameError` instead of continuing. When
the recorder is driven by `run_policy`, that ends the rollout with
`status="error"` naming the frame the recording stopped being complete at:

```
Policy failed: dataset add_frame failed after 7 frame(s) written; the recording
is incomplete from this frame on (strict=True, so it is not dropped silently):
<the underlying error>
```

Continuing past a lost frame is not a smaller failure. Timestamps are derived
positionally from the declared `fps`, so the surviving frames are re-stamped into
a shorter span than they were captured over - a rollout that loses every other
frame at 50 Hz produces an episode labelled at 2x speed, with no gap to detect.

Construct the recorder with `strict=False` to trade that for best-effort
recording: a failed write is counted in `dropped_frame_count`, warned about at
`WARNING` (on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th ... failure so a 50 Hz loop cannot flood the
log), and the rollout continues.

`strict` must be a boolean - it selects a posture, so it is checked on the same
domain as `use_videos` / `streaming_encoding` / `overwrite` rather than read by
truthiness, and a value outside it is a `ValueError` from the constructor:

```python
DatasetRecorder(dataset=ds, strict=None)      # ValueError: strict must be a boolean
DatasetRecorder(dataset=ds, strict="false")   # ValueError: strict must be a boolean
```

Read by truthiness these inverted in both directions. Every falsy non-boolean
(`None`, `0`, `""`, `[]`) selected best-effort recording without ever being a
declared spelling of it, so a run that lost a quarter of its frames completed and
reported success; and every non-empty string is truthy, so `strict="false"` - the
spelling reached for to opt out - selected fail-fast and then named `strict=True`
in the message above whatever the caller wrote.

### An episode the recorder cannot flush stops a recorded evaluation

`save_episode` is the episode-level counterpart, and a failed flush is worse than
a lost frame rather than milder. The recorder marks itself closed, because the
LeRobot episode buffer is in an undefined state after a partial write - and
`add_frame` returns immediately on a closed recorder, without writing a frame,
without raising `RecordingFrameError`, and without counting a
`dropped_frame_count`. Every later episode is therefore discarded in silence,
leaving no trace even in the recorder's own accounting.

So every flush refuses rather than continues. `save_episode()` and
`stop_recording()` drop the poisoned recorder and return `status="error"`,
`run_policy(n_episodes=N)` aborts its remaining episodes, `reset()` surfaces the
failure instead of resetting into an undefined state, and a recorded
`eval_policy` / `evaluate_benchmark` - one driven with an `on_frame` hook that
calls `add_frame`, which is the only way those two feed a recorder - stops at the
episode whose flush failed and reports the reason:

```python
result = sim.eval_policy(robot_name="so100", n_episodes=20, on_frame=hook)
payload = next(b["json"] for b in result["content"] if "json" in b)
if payload["recording_save_error"]:      # None on every healthy evaluation
    ...   # status is "error"; episodes_completed is the episode it stopped at
```

`episodes_completed` and `success_rate` then cover only the episodes that ran, so
an aggregate is never reported over episodes whose frames reached no dataset.

## Instance methods

| Method | What |
|--------|------|
| `add_frame(observation, action, task=None, camera_keys=None)` | Append one timestep |
| `save_episode()` | Flush buffer as a new episode |
| `clear_episode_buffer()` | Discard current episode |
| `finalize()` | Write metadata, stats, close writers |
| `push_to_hub(tags=None, private=False)` | Upload to a versioned HF dataset repo. `private` selects the published repo's visibility, so it must be a boolean — a truthy spelling of off such as `"false"` would otherwise select the opposite posture |
| `sync_to_bucket(bucket, run_id=None, private=True)` | Sync to a mutable HF Storage Bucket (`hf://buckets/...`) — Xet-deduped collection target; needs the `hf` CLI. `bucket` (`name` or `org/name`) and `run_id` (single segment) are allowlist-validated (`[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, no traversal) before the sync, and `create` / `private` / `delete` must each be a boolean — `delete` mirror-deletes remote files absent locally, so a truthy `"false"` must not select it |

`sync_to_bucket` needs the `hf` CLI with the `buckets`/`sync` subcommands
(`pip install -U "huggingface_hub>=1.5"` + `hf auth login` - those subcommands
first ship in 1.5.0; every earlier release, including 1.0-1.4.x, installs an
`hf` entry point without them).

`sync_to_bucket` is the recorder's own method, so it needs the live session.
Any dataset directory already on disk - recorded earlier in the process, or on
hardware via `lerobot-record` - syncs (or re-syncs daily) through the
module-level helper instead:

```python
from strands_robots import sync_dataset_to_bucket

sync_dataset_to_bucket("/tmp/demo", "your-org/robot-fave")
# -> {"status": "success", "bucket_uri": "hf://buckets/your-org/robot-fave/demo"}
```

`run_id` defaults to the directory name; pass `run_id="nightly"` to choose the
bucket subpath, and `delete=True` for mirror semantics.

## Read back

Fully materialized (downloads everything):

```python
from lerobot.datasets.lerobot_dataset import LeRobotDataset

ds = LeRobotDataset(repo_id="user/my_dataset", root="/tmp/my_dataset")
print(len(ds), ds[0].keys())
```

## Replay an episode

`sim.replay_episode(repo_id, robot_name=..., episode=0, root=None, speed=1.0)`
plays a recorded episode back through the sim: each recorded frame is one
control step, applied via `send_action` and integrated for a full control period
derived from the dataset fps, so a position-servo robot reproduces the recorded
trajectory. `speed` scales only the wall-clock playback rate.

`root` is resolved from `repo_id` exactly as recording resolves it, so whatever
id `start_recording` was given replays with nothing restated:

```python
sim.start_recording(repo_id="sim_recording", task="pick the cube", fps=30)
...
sim.stop_recording()
sim.replay_episode("sim_recording", robot_name="so101")   # same id, same directory
```

Each recorded action index is bound to an action key. By default those are
`robot_action_keys(robot_name)` — the robot's **actuator** keys, which is the
ordering the recorder writes the `action` column in. Pass `action_key_map` only
when the dataset's action ordering differs:

```python
sim.replay_episode(
    "user/my_dataset",
    robot_name="so101",
    root="/tmp/my_dataset",
    action_key_map=["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"],  # one key per action index
)
```

`action_key_map` must be a non-empty list/tuple of unique strings whose length
equals the recorded action vector's width. A bare string (consumed one key per
character), a non-string entry, a duplicate key, or a width mismatch is rejected
with an actionable error before the dataset is fetched — never truncated to fit.

A `"success"` status means **every** frame reached the actuators. If a recorded
action cannot be applied — e.g. the mapped keys resolve to no actuator on this
robot — the replay aborts at that frame and returns `status="error"` with the
frame index, how many frames were applied, and the unresolved keys:

```python
result = sim.replay_episode("user/my_dataset", robot_name="so101", action_key_map=["wrong"] * 6)
result["status"]                                  # "error"
result["content"][1]["json"]["unresolved_keys"]   # ['wrong', ...]
result["content"][1]["json"]["frames_applied"]    # 0
```

## Stream back (no full download)

`sim.stream_dataset()` is the in-process counterpart to `start_recording` /
`stop_recording` — it reads frames lazily from the Hub (or a local `root`) via
LeRobot's `StreamingLeRobotDataset`. Camera frames are decoded on the fly from
the MP4 shards; state/action come from the parquet shards.

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

sim = Robot("so100")
reader = sim.stream_dataset(
    "user/my_dataset",                 # a path-like repo_id needs no root=
    root="/tmp/my_dataset",
    delta_timestamps={                 # optional: stacked time windows + *_is_pad masks
        "observation.state": [-0.0667, -0.0333, 0.0],
        "action": [0.0, 0.0333, 0.0667],
    },
    buffer_size=1,                     # capture order for replay/eval:
    max_num_shards=1,                  # one reservoir slot, one shard
)
print(reader.num_episodes, reader.num_frames, reader.fps)
for frame in reader:
    ...

# torch DataLoader (shuffles INTERNALLY — do not pass shuffle=True):
for batch in reader.dataloader(batch_size=64, num_workers=4):
    ...
```

A `repo_id` that is itself a path (no `owner/name` slash, or `./`-prefixed) is
resolved to the directory recording wrote to, so the record -> read-back loop
needs no `root` restated:

```python
sim.start_recording(repo_id="sim_recording", task="pick the cube", fps=30)

sim.stop_recording()
reader = sim.stream_dataset("sim_recording")   # ./sim_recording, not the Hub
```

Equivalently, the standalone reader: `from strands_robots import StreamingDatasetReader`.

`shuffle` is **not** the read-order knob, and `shuffle=False` on its own reads
shuffled frames with nothing reporting it. It selects only which generator
drives the reordering (a generator reseeded from `seed` on every exhaustion, or
the dataset's advancing one), so it decides reproducibility *across epochs* —
lerobot documents it as "whether to shuffle the dataset across exhaustions".
`StreamingLeRobotDataset` reorders either way: it samples a shard at random per
frame and yields from a reservoir buffer. Capture order is therefore
`buffer_size=1` (a reservoir of one cannot reorder) plus `max_num_shards=1`
(a single shard has nothing to interleave), as above.

Useful kwargs (all forwarded to `StreamingLeRobotDataset`):
`episodes=[...]` (subset without download), `buffer_size`, `max_num_shards`,
`return_uint8=True` (default; halves frame bandwidth), and
`drop_videos=True` (proprio-only — skips video decode entirely, so it works on
edge devices without a torchcodec wheel; requires `delta_timestamps` with at
least one non-video key, otherwise `open()` raises `ValueError` rather than
silently streaming video anyway).

The four numeric kwargs (`tolerance_s`, `buffer_size`, `max_num_shards`,
`seed`) are checked before the lerobot import: `StreamingLeRobotDataset`
validates only `repo_type` and stores the rest verbatim, so every consumer of
them is downstream of a call that already returned. `open()` raises `ValueError`
naming the parameter instead - a shard count of `0` used to open successfully
and then stream **zero frames**, a `buffer_size` of `0` raised out of NumPy
part-way through iteration, and a `tolerance_s` of `inf` switched off the
delta-grid check below. `tolerance_s=0` is accepted and means "require an exact
grid match"; `seed=0` is accepted and is simply a seed.

The five boolean kwargs (`streaming`, `shuffle`, `return_uint8`,
`validate_deltas`, `drop_videos`) are checked there too, on the same domain the
recording postures use ([A posture flag must be a
boolean](#a-posture-flag-must-be-a-boolean)) and for the same reason - read by
truthiness, each selected the branch the caller was opting *out* of:

```python
reader = sim.stream_dataset("user/d", drop_videos="false")  # ValueError: drop_videos must be a boolean
reader = sim.stream_dataset("user/d", validate_deltas=0)    # same refusal
```

`drop_videos="false"` (also `"no"`, `"off"`, `"0"`) is truthy, so it *removed*
the camera keys from `delta_timestamps` - the opposite of the opt-out it spells -
and when nothing but camera keys were requested it reported
`drop_videos=True requires ...`, naming a value the caller had never passed and
pointing at a remedy that lands on the silent proprio-only stream. Falsy
non-booleans took the other branch just as silently: `validate_deltas=0` skipped
the delta-grid check, so an off-grid `delta_timestamps` that `validate_deltas=True`
refuses opened and streamed; `return_uint8=None` streamed float32 at ~4x the
bandwidth of the uint8 it spells; and
`streaming=0` failed inside LeRobot on `num_shards`. `reader.dataloader(shuffle=...)`
needs no such check - it discards the key whatever it held.

Every kwarg is forwarded unconditionally: each lerobot-bearing extra floors
lerobot at `0.6.1`, whose `StreamingLeRobotDataset` accepts all of them —
`repo_type` included. `open()` therefore never drops a keyword to suit an older
constructor, which for `repo_type` would have streamed the versioned dataset
namespace instead of the requested bucket, a different storage system. An
environment carrying a below-floor lerobot gets lerobot's own `TypeError`
naming the keyword.

For **training**, the upstream trainer uses the same engine:

```bash
lerobot-train --policy.type=act \
  --dataset.repo_id=user/my_dataset --dataset.streaming=true --num_workers=4
```

(`lerobot-train` is the entry point over `python -m lerobot.scripts.lerobot_train`;
flags are draccus `--dotted.key=value` form.)

> **macOS:** video streaming needs Homebrew ffmpeg on the dyld path. `import
> strands_robots` auto-fixes this (zero-touch); disable with
> `STRANDS_ROBOTS_NO_DYLD_SHIM=1`.
