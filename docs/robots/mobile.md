# Mobile, mobile manip, and aerial

Quadrupeds, wheeled bases, mobile manipulators, and quadcopters.

```python
from strands_robots import Robot
sim = Robot("unitree_go2")      # Unitree Go2 quadruped
sim = Robot("spot")             # Boston Dynamics Spot
sim = Robot("stretch3")         # Hello Robot Stretch 3 (mobile manip)
sim = Robot("crazyflie")        # Bitcraze Crazyflie 2 quadcopter
```

## Catalog

Every robot in this family, generated from `robots.json` at build time. Renders are MuJoCo sim renders, never hardware photos.

## Flying a real Crazyflie

`crazyflie` declares `hardware.driver = "strands"`, so `mode="real"` builds the native
CRTP driver over a [Crazyradio](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyradio-2-0/) dongle.
lerobot has no robot type for a Crazyflie, so this is the only way to fly one from here.

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

cf = Robot("crazyflie", mode="real", port="radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E7E7")

# Opens the link and WAITS for the aircraft to answer, then ARMS the platform and
# starts telemetry. Returns None on success, or a reason - check it: nothing below
# can fly if the link never came up.
if (reason := cf.connect_eagerly()) is not None:
    raise SystemExit(reason)

# Every flight verb answers with an envelope, including for a link that went quiet
# after connecting - so read `status` rather than assuming the write landed. Each
# step is checked before the next is issued: after a refused takeoff there is no
# altitude for the twist to hold.
try:
    env = cf.takeoff(height=0.5, duration=2.0)
    if env["status"] == "success":
        env = cf.set_twist(vx=0.2, wz=1.0, z=0.5)  # 0.2 m/s fwd, 1.0 rad/s yaw, 0.5 m
    if env["status"] == "success":
        env = cf.land()                            # descends under control
    if env["status"] != "success":
        print(env["content"][0]["text"])
finally:
    cf.cleanup()  # lands if it is still flying, then releases the radio
```

Install the client library with the `crazyflie` extra:
`pip install "strands-robots[crazyflie]"`. It is **not** part of `[all]` - `cflib` is
GPLv3 and this project is Apache-2.0, so the copyleft dependency is only installed by a
caller who names it. Without it the driver still imports and registers; it reports a
reason naming this extra instead of connecting.

Five things behave differently from a ground robot, and each one is a way to break the
aircraft if you assume otherwise:

| | What to know |
|---|---|
| **Connecting waits** | `cflib`'s `open_link` is asynchronous and never raises - it reports failure on a *callback*, so an absent dongle or a switched-off aircraft returns normally. `connect_eagerly()` therefore blocks until the aircraft answers (up to `CONNECT_TIMEOUT_S`, 10 s) and returns the reason if it does not. Check that return: while there is no link `cflib` discards every packet in silence. |
| **Units** | `wz` is **rad/s**, as everywhere else in this package. `cflib` wants deg/s, and the driver is the only place that conversion happens. |
| **Setpoints are a stream** | The firmware supervisor cuts thrust when the setpoint stream goes quiet, so one `send_action` latches a setpoint and a background repeater keeps it alive at `setpoint_hz` (default 20 Hz). It returns when the setpoint is latched, not when the motion is done. |
| **`stop` lands** | `stop()` / `stop_task()` / `cleanup()` all perform a controlled descent. Cutting the motors - an airborne aircraft *falls* - is the separately named `emergency_stop()`, and the agent tool schema cannot reach it. |
| **A link can go quiet in flight** | `is_connected` reads True for a link that opened and then stopped answering - the handle is live and only the write finds out. So every flight verb returns an error envelope for a write the radio would not carry, rather than raising: check `status` on `send_action` / `set_twist` / `takeoff` / `land` / `emergency_stop`, not just on `connect_eagerly()`. Two of those refusals carry a consequence worth acting on - a refused priority handover means the climb or descent was *not* commanded, and a refused `emergency_stop` means the motors are **still turning** with the setpoint stream already stopped, so only a hardware cutoff will stop the aircraft. |

The flight envelope is the driver's, not the SDK's: `cflib` imposes no ceiling and the
firmware attempts whatever arrives. A setpoint outside it is **refused by name**, never
clamped, so a caller who asked for 5 m/s never silently flies 1 m/s. Read the bounds with
`strands_robots.drivers.crazyflie.twist_envelope()`.

Commands go through `send_action` / `set_twist` / `takeoff` / `land`; `start_task` and
`run_policy` refuse, because this package registers no aerial policy provider and a
quadcopter has no joints for a manipulation policy's action to land on. Telemetry
(`stateEstimate` position, `stabilizer` attitude, `pm.vbat`) is cached for the mesh; a bare
Crazyflie has no ranger deck, so no lidar topic is published.

## Real hardware: the Go2 native driver

The Go2 has no lerobot robot type, so `mode="real"` builds the native CycloneDDS
driver in `strands_robots.drivers.go2`. Its registry entry declares
`hardware.driver = "strands"`, so no `driver=` keyword is needed:

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

go2 = Robot("go2", mode="real", port="192.168.123.161", network_interface="eth0")
go2.connect_eagerly()          # subscribes rt/lowstate and rt/sportmodestate
go2.release_sport_mode()       # hands the legs over - see below
go2.send_action({"FL_calf_joint": -1.5})
```

Two Go2 specifics are worth knowing before writing a controller.

**Sport mode must be released first.** The Go2 ships with an onboard sport-mode
service driving the legs. Until it is released, a `rt/lowcmd` frame puts that
controller and your commands on the same twelve motors, so every write path
(`send_action`, `run_policy`, `start_task`) refuses until `release_sport_mode()`
confirms the robot reports no active mode. Releasing is deliberately *not* a side
effect of `connect_eagerly()`, which only subscribes to read.

**Actions are keyed by joint name, never by index.** `rt/lowcmd`'s `motor_cmd`
array follows Unitree's `LegID` order - front-right, front-left, rear-right,
rear-left - while the Go2's own URDF/MJCF description declares its joints
front-left, front-right, rear-left, rear-right. The two orders hold the same
twelve joints, so zipping a description-ordered vector onto `motor_cmd` produces
twelve valid commands aimed at the mirror-image legs, with a correct CRC and
nothing in any log to say so. `GO2_JOINT_INDEX` is the one place the two
conventions are reconciled:

![Go2 LegID transposition](../assets/go2_legid_transposition.png)

_The same command, run in MuJoCo on the official Go2 description. Left: keyed by
name through `GO2_JOINT_INDEX`, the front-left leg lifts. Right: the identical
twelve-value vector written to `motor_cmd` in description order - the front-right
leg lifts instead._

| Description order (URDF/MJCF) | Wire slot (`motor_cmd` index) |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------:|
| `FL_hip_joint` / `_thigh_` / `_calf_` | 3, 4, 5 |
| `FR_hip_joint` / `_thigh_` / `_calf_` | 0, 1, 2 |
| `RL_hip_joint` / `_thigh_` / `_calf_` | 9, 10, 11 |
| `RR_hip_joint` / `_thigh_` / `_calf_` | 6, 7, 8 |

Telemetry read back through `go2.state` is keyed by the same names, so the read
path cannot be transposed either.

`run_policy(policy_object=...)` rolls a callable or a `Policy` on a 500 Hz thread,
re-checks both gates every step, and publishes a zero-gain (but still enabled)
soft-stop frame on the way out rather than cutting the motors dead. Poll
`get_task_status()`; `stop_task()` reports honestly whether the loop actually
joined.

`get_task_status()` keeps answering after the rollout's thread is gone, and its
`exit_reason` names whichever of these ended it — so a caller who polls late
still learns why the robot stopped moving:

| `exit_reason` | What happened |
|---------------|---------------|
| `n_steps` / `duration` | the rollout ran its budget out |
| `gate` | sport mode was taken back, or the battery fell under the floor (`exit_detail` says which) |
| `policy` | the policy raised, returned `None`, or named a joint this robot does not have |
| `publish` | the frame did not reach `rt/lowcmd` |
| `stop_task` / `stop` / `cleanup` | a caller halted it — `stop_task()`, the mesh's `stop` verb, or teardown |

## Real hardware: the EarthRover native driver

`earthrover` declares `hardware.lerobot_type`, so `mode="real"` builds the lerobot robot
by default; `driver="strands"` selects the native driver instead. That driver talks to the
vendor's [earth-rovers-sdk](https://github.com/frodobots-org/earth-rovers-sdk) over HTTP,
which proxies to the rover, and `port=` is that SDK's base URL.

That transport is `requests`, supplied by `pip install 'strands-robots[earthrover]'`
(a member of `[all]`). Without it the driver still imports and registers, and
`connect_eagerly()` returns a reason naming the extra rather than raising.

```python
from strands_robots import Robot

rover = Robot("earthrover", mode="real", driver="strands", port="http://10.0.0.9:8001")
if (reason := rover.connect_eagerly()) is not None:   # proves GET /data answers
    raise SystemExit(reason)

rover.send_action({"linear": 0.4, "angular": -0.2})    # each axis normalised to [-1, 1]
rover.cleanup()                                        # sends a parting zero twist
```

The driver *is* the agent's tool, so an agent gets the rover's whole surface by holding it:

```python
from strands import Agent

Agent(tools=[rover])("drive forward for two seconds, then show me the front camera")
```

| `action` | Parameters | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `sensors` | - | Telemetry snapshot: a one-line summary block plus the whole `/data` JSON. Refuses when the SDK has never answered, rather than reporting an empty rover. |
| `status` | - | Connection state, the SDK URL and the last commanded twist. |
| `camera` | `camera` (`front`/`rear`) | One frame, as an image block the model can see. |
| `move` | `linear`, `angular`, `duration_s` | One twist. With `duration_s` (at most 30 s) the twist is held and a zero twist follows; the answer reports both halves, so a lost trailing stop is an error and not a completed move. |
| `lamp` | `on` | Switches the headlamp - and stops, because the SDK carries `lamp` inside the one `/control` twist frame. |
| `speak` | `text` | Says `text` through the rover's speaker. |
| `stop` | - | A zero twist, and the envelope says whether it reached the SDK. |

An `action` outside that enum is refused naming the declared verbs, never dispatched onto
the halt. Writes are judged on the driver's own write path, so `move` and `send_action` are
refused by the same sentence.

Both axes are a fraction of full speed, so `1.0` is already the fastest value there is and
a magnitude above it is **refused by name**, never clamped - the same disposition as the
Crazyflie envelope above, for the reason the rover makes sharper: it is velocity-commanded,
so a twist it was not asked for keeps running until the next command. Clamping sent every
out-of-range magnitude at full speed, which is exactly what a caller writing the value on a
percent scale needs to be told about: `linear=1` and `linear=100` are the same command once
both saturate. `lamp` is read as a boolean rather than for truthiness, so `lamp="off"`
is refused instead of switching the headlamp on.

The `sensors` summary reads the lamp the same way. The SDK carries the field as the `1`/`0`
that `lamp` write puts on the wire, so those integers and the two booleans are the readings;
anything else - a firmware that no longer carries `lamp`, or one that spells it `"off"` -
reads `?`, like every other field the snapshot does not carry. Read for truthiness the
summary answered for the rover: a dropped field reported the headlamp *off* and the string
`"off"` reported it *on*. The whole `/data` block beside the summary is unchanged, so a
caller that wants the raw field still reads it.

Every endpoint - including `POST /control`, which *drives* - is built from that one
string, so it has to address the host you wrote. A value whose authority names one host
and resolves to another is refused at construction, because the transport does not refuse
it: it reports only the host it ended up with, and `connect_eagerly()` reports success
whenever something answers there.

| `port=` | Result |
|---|---|
| omitted, `http://10.0.0.9:8001`, `10.0.0.9:8001`, `https://rover.local:8001` | Accepted. A bare `host:port` is prefixed with `http://`. |
| `HTTP://10.0.0.9:8001`, `http://[::1]:8001`, `10.0.0.9:8001/rover-7` | Accepted - the scheme is case-insensitive, an IPv6 literal keeps its brackets, and a path prefix survives for an SDK behind a reverse proxy. |
| `bot.local@10.0.0.9:8001` | **Refused.** Everything before the `@` is userinfo, so `10.0.0.9` is dialled while the address still reads as `bot.local`. |
| `ws://10.0.0.9:8001` | **Refused.** The SDK is plain HTTP; left alone, `ws` becomes the host and the port you wrote is discarded. |
| `/tmp/rover.sock` | **Refused** - that shape belongs to the serial arms. |

A URL that cannot be used at all - `http://`, an out-of-range port, an embedded space -
is left to `requests`, which already names it; `connect_eagerly()` returns that reason
rather than raising.
