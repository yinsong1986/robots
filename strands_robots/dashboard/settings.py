    security posture rather than tidiness. Writing the path and tightening it
    afterwards got that wrong in two ways, both measured:

    * The payload was written at the umask default and chmod-ed only *after* the
      rename, so at ``umask 022`` the token sat in a ``0o644`` file for the

    * The ``chmod`` was best-effort under a silent ``except OSError``, so where it
      could not be applied the token stayed world-readable **permanently**, with
      no log line to say so.

    ``mkstemp`` opens at ``0o600`` and ``os.replace`` carries those bits onto the
    destination, so the mode is a property of how the file is created rather than
    a call that may or may not land -- which also tightens a settings file left
    at ``0o644`` by an earlier build the next time it is written. The rename is
    atomic within a directory, so a concurrent reader sees either the whole
    previous file or the whole new one, never a prefix; the old fixed-name
    ``.tmp`` sibling was also shared by every writer that reached it.

    This is the sequence :func:`strands_robots.dashboard.auth._save_locked` uses
