"""WebAuthn (passkey) authentication for the dashboard. Why this exists: the dashboard commands
real hardware (SO-101 arms).

A ceremony is verified against two expectations, and neither may come from the
caller: ``expected_rp_id`` from the challenge record this process stashed, and
``expected_origin`` from the connection the request actually arrived on (see
:func:`origin_verdict`). What the request ASSERTS about itself -- its ``Origin``
header, ``x-forwarded-proto``, ``x-forwarded-for`` -- is a claim, and a claim is
only ever compared against an expectation, never promoted into one.

Configuration:
    ``STRANDS_DASH_AUTH_ORIGIN``: the origin the dashboard is served at, e.g.
        ``https://robots.example``. Unset by default, in which case it is read off
        the connection: the transport's own scheme plus the ``Host`` header. Set
        it when a proxy rewrites ``Host`` or ``Origin``, or when TLS is terminated
        upstream and the server is not configured to forward that fact (uvicorn's
        ``--proxy-headers`` with ``--forwarded-allow-ips``, which is where the
        trusted-proxy decision belongs). WebAuthn compares origins byte-for-byte,
        so it must carry the scheme and any non-default port.
    ``STRANDS_DASH_AUTH_RP_ID``: pins the relying-party id when the hostname
        legitimately changed. See :func:`rp_id_verdict`.
    ``STRANDS_DASH_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN``: the secret the FIRST passkey
        enrollment must present. Unset by default, in which case the module
        mints one itself and keeps it in a ``0600`` file beside the credential
        store (``STRANDS_DASH_AUTH_ENROLL_TOKEN_FILE`` relocates it); see
        :func:`_first_enrollment_proof`. Either way the first enrollment is
        never admitted on the strength of where the connection appears to come
        from - a loopback peer is not proof of presence at the machine.
    ``STRANDS_DASH_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL`` (default 86400), ``..._SESSION_MAX_AGE``
        (default 2592000) and ``..._HANDOFF_TTL`` (default 300): how long a
        session token lives, the absolute age past which no renewal extends it,
        and the lifetime of a handoff token. All three are a whole number of
        SECONDS, read through :func:`_duration`, which refuses a value it cannot
        use rather than substituting the default: these are how the window in
        which a session commands hardware gets narrowed, and every direction a
        substituted default lands in is the wider one.
    ``STRANDS_DASH_AUTH_CHAL_MAX`` (default 512) and
        ``STRANDS_DASH_AUTH_CHAL_MAX_PER_IP`` (default 16): bounds on the table of
        in-flight WebAuthn challenges. The per-ip cap must stay strictly below the
        global one -- it is what keeps one client off the global cap, whose eviction
        is ip-blind. Both are read through :func:`_challenge_cap`, which refuses a
        pair that cannot hold a flooding client's entries and the operator's pending
        login at the same time.
