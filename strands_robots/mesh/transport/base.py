"""Pluggable transport protocol for the strands-robots mesh.

Defines the Protocol that :class:`~strands_robots.mesh.core.Mesh` uses to
publish and subscribe. Every concrete backend (Zenoh, AWS IoT MQTT, Bridge)
implements this protocol.

The protocol is deliberately tiny — exactly what ``mesh.session`` already
exposed. Every behavioural enrichment (peer registry, RPC correlation, audit)
lives at the Mesh layer and is transport-agnostic.

Why ``Sample`` is duck-typed
----------------------------
Zenoh callbacks receive a ``zenoh.Sample`` with ``.key_expr`` and
``.payload.to_bytes()``. AWS IoT MQTT5 callbacks receive a topic string and
``bytes`` payload. Rather than pick a concrete type and force one transport
to adapt, we declare the **structural protocol** all callers actually use:

    sample.key_expr        # str  — the topic / key the message arrived on
    sample.payload.to_bytes()  # bytes — the raw payload

Concrete backends produce objects matching this shape. The MQTT backend ships
a tiny ``_MqttSample`` wrapper; the Zenoh backend passes ``zenoh.Sample``
through unchanged.

    Lifetime contract
    -----------------
    Implementations are ref-counted singletons per process, mirroring the
    existing :func:`~strands_robots.mesh.session.get_session` /
    :func:`~strands_robots.mesh.session.release_session` pair.

    - The first :class:`Mesh` to require a transport calls :func:`get_transport`
      which constructs (or returns) the singleton and increments its refcount.
    - Each :class:`Mesh.stop` calls :func:`release_transport` exactly once.
    - When the refcount reaches zero, :meth:`close` is invoked.

    Failure mode
    ------------
    A transport whose connection is dead returns ``False`` from
    :meth:`is_alive`. Callers (notably :func:`put`) treat a dead transport as
    a no-op rather than raising — preserving the current Mesh contract that
    publish failures never propagate up into hot control loops.

        ``.key_expr`` (the topic string) and ``.payload.to_bytes()`` (the
        payload bytes).

        Wildcard translation:
            Zenoh ``*``  matches one segment → MQTT ``+``
