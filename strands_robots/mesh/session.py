"""Shared Zenoh session and peer registry for the mesh networking layer.

This module provides a single, ref-counted :func:`zenoh.open` session per process
and a thread-safe registry of discovered peers.  It is the lowest layer of the
mesh stack - higher-level constructs (``Mesh``, presence, RPC) build on top.

The Zenoh dependency is **lazy**: ``import strands_robots.mesh_session`` does not
import ``zenoh`` at module level.  The first call to :func:`get_session` triggers
the real import.  If ``eclipse-zenoh`` is not installed the function returns
``None`` and all publish helpers become safe no-ops.

Connection strategy (when no explicit endpoint is configured):

1. Try to **listen** on ``tcp/127.0.0.1:{STRANDS_MESH_PORT}`` - this makes the
   first process the local router.
2. If the port is already bound, fall back to **client** mode and connect to the
   same endpoint.
3. Zenoh gossip scouting propagates peers reachable through those endpoints.
   Multicast scouting is **disabled by default** (LAN discovery attack
   surface); operators on a controlled LAN can opt in with
   ``STRANDS_MESH_MULTICAST=true``. Cross-host peers otherwise need explicit
   ``ZENOH_CONNECT`` endpoints.

Environment variables
---------------------
``ZENOH_CONNECT``
    Comma-separated remote endpoint(s) - e.g. ``tcp/10.0.0.1:7447``.
``ZENOH_LISTEN``
    Comma-separated listen endpoint(s).
``STRANDS_MESH_PORT``
    Local auto-mesh port (default ``7447``).
``STRANDS_MESH``
    Set to ``false`` to disable mesh globally.
``STRANDS_MESH_MULTICAST``
    ``true`` to opt into LAN multicast scouting (logs a warning).
    Default ``false``.

    relays for it. The property the previous peer-mode fallback was chosen for

    client re-links to a restarted hub on its own (measured: 30 frames before

    Two call sites throttle ``publish_step`` against a monotonic clock -- the
    hardware control loop (``HardwareRobot.__init__``) and the simulation
    ``run_policy`` hook -- and both did it by dividing
    ``STRANDS_MESH_STREAM_HZ`` straight from the environment. That raises
    ``ZeroDivisionError`` on ``0`` and ``ValueError`` on any non-numeric value,
    and one of those divisions runs in a constructor, so the failure is not
    "telemetry degraded" but "every ``Robot(..., mode="real")`` construction
    raises". ``0`` is a realistic input rather than an adversarial one: the
    sibling knob ``STRANDS_MESH_CAMERA_HZ`` advertises non-positive as off, so
    an operator disabling step telemetry the same way bricked hardware
    bring-up.

    A period rather than a rate is returned because that is what both callers
    hold, and it lets "off" be expressed as ``inf``: no *finite* elapsed time
    reaches an infinite period, so the throttle refuses every step it is asked
    about.

    That is a property of the elapsed time as much as of the period, so it does
    not survive every base. A caller starting its throttle base at ``-inf`` --
    which is what a monotonic base wants to be, a reading being meaningful only
    relative to another one, so that a rollout's first step is due wherever the
    platform's epoch sits -- computes an infinite elapsed time on that first
    step, and ``inf >= inf`` is true. The subtraction alone then lets exactly
    one publish past the opt-out. Such a caller tests this value for finiteness
    once, where it resolves it, and gates the publish on that: the returned
    period alone is not the whole opt-out.

    The fallback for an unusable value follows :meth:`Mesh._resolve_camera_hz`,
    the other opt-out publishing loop: warn naming the variable and the
    offending value, then leave publishing off rather than substitute a rate
    the operator did not ask for. Step telemetry is observability, not control,
    so nothing downstream misbehaves when it stops -- and the warning is what
    makes "no step tiles" diagnosable.

    Reads one entry of the :func:`get_peers` snapshot - the flat dict
    :meth:`PeerInfo.to_dict` returns, which spreads the peer's presence payload
    at the top level rather than nesting it under a ``presence`` key. Every
    marker below is a key some publisher in
    :meth:`~strands_robots.mesh.core.Mesh._build_presence` really sets, so no
    rung is dead on arrival.

    Fail-closed means: physical unless the peer can be SHOWN to be a sim. An
    absent peer, a peer whose presence carries no sim marker, and a marker this
    function cannot read are all metal. The direction of each rung follows from
    that, and the two directions are deliberately different:

    * ``hw`` is a positive METAL marker, so it is read permissively (any
      non-empty string) and checked first - a peer reporting real hardware is
      metal whatever else it claims.
    * ``robot_type`` and ``world`` are positive SIM markers, so they are read
      strictly (an exact token; ``world is True``, not merely truthy). A value
      this function cannot read falls through to metal instead of being taken
      for a sim.

    The verdict is a description, never an authorisation: ``robot_type`` and
    ``world`` arrive over the wire from the peer itself and
    :meth:`~strands_robots.mesh.core.Mesh._on_presence` authenticates neither,
    so a peer can claim to be a sim. That is fit to tell an operator what the
    peer says about itself, and unfit to stand in for the operator.

    Args:
        peer: One entry of the :func:`get_peers` snapshot, or ``None`` when the
            peer is not on it.

    The publish companion to :func:`_get_zenoh_session_directly`, and the
    function :func:`put` itself calls once the backend branch is not taken - so
    the raw JSON encode-and-publish lives in exactly one place.

    :class:`~strands_robots.mesh.transport.zenoh_transport.ZenohTransport` must
    publish through here rather than :func:`put`: under
    ``STRANDS_MESH_BACKEND=bridge`` the backend-aware :func:`put` resolves the
    active transport, which is the
    :class:`~strands_robots.mesh.transport.bridge_transport.BridgeTransport`
    that owns that very ``ZenohTransport`` - so the payload would route back
    into the bridge instead of onto the wire.

    Fire-and-forget, and it reads ``_SESSION`` without taking
    ``_SESSION_LOCK`` exactly as :func:`put` always has: a 50 Hz teleop loop
    must not serialise on the session lock.

    The JSON encode is attempted OUTSIDE the handler that absorbs a wire
    failure, because the two outcomes are not the same kind of failure. A wire
    failure is transient and the next tick retries it, so it stays at DEBUG. A
    payload the encoder refuses can never be published, so it is reported
    through :func:`_report_unencodable_payload` instead of being absorbed by the
    same DEBUG line. Neither raises: the ``put`` contract is fire-and-forget
    either way. The encode catch is deliberately wide because an arbitrary
    payload object can carry an arbitrary ``__reduce__`` / ``keys`` / ``default``
    hook, so the encoder's raise set is not enumerable here (``json.dumps``
    itself raises ``TypeError`` for an unsupported type and ``ValueError`` for a
