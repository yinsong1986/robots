"""Device Shadow mirror — reflects presence/state to AWS IoT named shadows.

When the robot is online, every presence heartbeat ALSO updates the named
shadow ``presence`` for the Thing. When the robot is offline, the shadow
stays as the last reported state — late-joining operators (Bedrock agents,
fleet ops dashboards) read fleet state via ``GetThingShadow`` REST without
subscribing to MQTT.

Why mirror to a named shadow rather than the unnamed default
------------------------------------------------------------
Named shadows allow per-topic-family separation: a robot publishes its
presence to ``shadow/name/presence``, its task state to
``shadow/name/task``, its health to ``shadow/name/health``, etc. Each can
be queried independently. The unnamed default shadow becomes a single
massive blob otherwise.

Hooking in
----------
:class:`ShadowMirror` exposes :meth:`update` (call from anywhere) and a
ready-to-wire convenience :func:`enable_for_mesh` that binds it to the
heartbeat path automatically. Today the heartbeat path is
:meth:`Mesh._heartbeat_loop` which calls ``put(strands/{peer}/presence, ...)``
— we hook in by registering a publish-side observer that mirrors any
presence write to the shadow update topic.

Failure mode
------------
Shadow updates are **best effort**: if the IoT transport isn't connected,
the update is dropped silently. A 0.5 Hz health update missing from the
shadow does not affect the live mesh.
