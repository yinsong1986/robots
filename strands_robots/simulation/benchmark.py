"""Benchmark-agnostic evaluation protocol for any ``SimEngine``.

Every standard benchmark (LIBERO, Meta-World, RoboSuite, ManiSkill, user-authored
tasks) has a different notion of "what a task is" - sparse-success, dense-reward,
procedural scenes, BDDL predicates, hardcoded robots, etc. The correct abstraction
is the protocol the eval loop calls into, not a benchmark-specific schema.

:class:`BenchmarkProtocol` is that protocol. Each adapter implements a handful of
lifecycle hooks (``on_episode_start``, ``on_step``, ``is_success``, ``is_failure``)
and declares the robots it is compatible with. The evaluation loop
(:meth:`~strands_robots.simulation.policy_runner.PolicyRunner.evaluate`) drives
the protocol without knowing anything about the underlying benchmark.

Adapters live in optional extras (``strands-robots[benchmark-libero]`` etc.);
the core package stays dependency-free. A reference :class:`DeclarativeBenchmark`
shipped in :mod:`strands_robots.simulation.benchmark_spec` turns a YAML/JSON
spec into a fully functional ``BenchmarkProtocol`` instance - LLMs can author
and register benchmarks at runtime without writing Python code.

Registry: a module-level ``dict[str, BenchmarkProtocol]`` keyed by name,
mirroring the shape of :func:`~strands_robots.simulation.model_registry.register_urdf`.
Registration is idempotent-by-overwrite: re-registering the same name replaces
the previous entry and logs a warning. This matches how users iterate on a
spec file during development.

Thread safety: the registry is guarded by an internal lock so concurrent
registrations from agent threads do not race. The benchmark instances
themselves are expected to be immutable after registration - adapters that
keep per-episode state MUST put it on the ``rng``-scoped call, not on ``self``.
