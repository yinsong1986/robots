"""Dataclasses for simulation state.

These dataclasses provide a backend-independent typed state representation
consumed by simulation engine implementations (e.g. MuJoCo, Isaac Sim,
PyBullet).

They enable:
    - Type-safe state tracking across simulation steps.
    - Serialisation for checkpoints and trajectory recording.
    - A backend-independent interface for agent tools.

They are defined alongside the ``SimEngine`` ABC because its method
signatures reference them (e.g. ``create_world() → SimWorld``).

      buffers, caches, etc. Prefer this over adding new fields here.
