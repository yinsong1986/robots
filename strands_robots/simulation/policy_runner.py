"""Backend-agnostic policy execution against any ``SimEngine``.

Runs the canonical obs → act → step loop using only the public ``SimEngine``
interface. Zero knowledge of the underlying physics engine - MuJoCo, Isaac,
Newton and any future backend get ``run_policy`` / ``replay`` / ``evaluate``
for free by implementing the ``SimEngine`` primitives.

Three entry points:

* :meth:`PolicyRunner.run` - blocking policy execution with optional video.
* :meth:`PolicyRunner.replay` - replay a recorded LeRobotDataset episode.
* :meth:`PolicyRunner.evaluate` - multi-episode evaluation with success metrics.

All three call only these public ``SimEngine`` methods:

* ``get_observation(robot_name)``
* ``send_action(action, robot_name, n_substeps)``
* ``step(n_steps)``
* ``reset()``
* ``render(camera_name, width, height)``

And two public helpers for robot discovery:

* ``list_robots()`` - ordered robot names in the world
* ``robot_joint_names(robot_name)`` - ordered joint names for a robot

Thread safety: ``PolicyRunner`` itself is stateless per invocation. The
underlying ``SimEngine`` is responsible for thread-safety inside its own
methods (e.g. MuJoCo acquires a lock inside ``send_action`` / ``step``).

    """Seed Python / NumPy / torch RNGs for reproducible eval rollouts.

    Mirrors NVIDIA's ``set_seed`` from
    ``Isaac-GR00T/scripts/deployment/standalone_inference_script.py:81``,
    minus two global side effects that would persist after the eval and
    affect unrelated callers in the same process:

    * ``os.environ["CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG"] = ":4096:8"`` — leaks into
      every subsequent torch op in the process.
    * ``torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True, warn_only=True)`` —
      can break callers downstream that rely on non-deterministic CUDA
      kernels (e.g. some loss functions).

    Users who want NVIDIA's exact strict-determinism mode can set those
    themselves before calling :meth:`evaluate_benchmark`. The defaults
    here cover the common case: reproducible rollouts of the SAME
    policy + seed combination, without forcing the rest of the process
    into deterministic-only mode.

    Seeds applied:

    * Python ``random.seed``.
    * NumPy ``np.random.seed`` (the legacy global RNG; matches what
      most policies use under the hood).
    * PyTorch CPU (``torch.manual_seed``) — if torch is importable.
    * PyTorch CUDA all devices (``torch.cuda.manual_seed_all``) — if
      torch is importable AND CUDA is available.
    * cuDNN ``deterministic=True`` / ``benchmark=False`` — if torch
      is importable. These are the standard reproducibility knobs and
      are scoped to torch (not the broader environment) so the side
      effect surface is acceptable.

    Public since #179: standalone integration tests
    (``tests_integ/.../test_libero_10_scene5_mujoco_engine_success_rate``)
    bypass :meth:`evaluate_benchmark` and need to call this directly to
    get reproducible policy rollouts. The leading ``_`` was an oversight
    from #168 round 38; the function is the supported way to seed an
    eval and is part of the public API.

    NumPy / torch are imported lazily so this helper works on minimal
    installs that don't have torch (e.g. ``policy_provider="mock"``
    smoke tests).

          ``is_success`` / ``is_failure`` hooks, cumulative dense reward,
          robot-compatibility validation. ``max_steps`` from the spec wins.
        * **``success_fn=``**: legacy sparse-success path kept for
          backwards compatibility with PR #85. Equivalent to a
          ``BenchmarkProtocol`` whose ``on_step`` always returns
          ``StepInfo(reward=0.0, done=False)``.

        Passing both ``spec`` and ``success_fn`` is an error - benchmarks
        define their own success predicate.

        Args:
            robot_name: Robot to evaluate.
            policy: Already-constructed ``Policy`` instance.
            instruction: Instruction forwarded to the policy.
            n_episodes: Number of reset → rollout episodes.
            max_steps: Cap per episode. Ignored when ``spec`` is provided
                (``spec.max_steps`` wins).

            spec: :class:`BenchmarkProtocol` to drive the eval. When
                provided, overrides the ``success_fn`` path.
            seed: Master RNG seed. Each episode derives a child RNG from it,
                so evaluations are reproducible within a process. Only used
                when ``spec`` is provided.
            on_frame: Optional ``(step, observation, action) -> None`` hook
                fired per applied control step on the eval thread, after
                ``sim.send_action``. Currently only forwarded on the
                ``spec=`` path (the legacy ``success_fn`` path doesn't
                expose telemetry hooks). Use this for synchronous
                recording when the eval runs on a thread distinct from
