        recording the actions, so the episode trains nothing and reports success.

        Both seeds keep the "only the robot's OWN base" guarantee, and for the
        same reason: a sibling task object -- a free-jointed cube, including one
        shipped inside the robot's own MJCF under its namespace, which is how
        every Menagerie grasping scene is authored -- carries neither a declared
        joint of the robot nor any actuator of it, so it is on no seed's ancestor
        chain. Ownership of the actuators is resolved by
        :func:`~strands_robots.simulation.mujoco.scene_ops.robot_owned_actuator_ids`
        rather than re-derived here, and the body it lands on is then checked
        against the robot's namespace by :meth:`_body_is_namespaced`. That second
        check is not redundant: one of the two ownership rules matches an actuator
        by the joint id it drives, and a stored id does not survive
        ``replace_scene_mjcf`` -- after a replace it addresses whatever that index
        means in the newly compiled model, so an unrelated machine's actuator can
        be claimed and its base reported as this robot's. A name cannot be
        borrowed that way. A fixed-base arm has no ancestor free joint from either
        seed and returns ``-1``.

        Named cameras: the world-from-camera pose comes from
        ``data.cam_xpos`` / ``data.cam_xmat``. MuJoCo's camera basis already
        matches the OpenGL optical convention (+X right, +Y up, -Z forward),
        so the pose maps across without correction. Intrinsics ``K``: a
        camera declared with an explicit physical sensor (MJCF
        ``sensorsize`` / ``focal`` / ``principal`` / ``resolution``) gets its
        ``K`` from the view frustum MuJoCo computes for that camera, so
        non-square pixels (``fx != fy``) and an off-center principal point are
        honored exactly as this MuJoCo build rasterizes them - including the
        vertical principal-point convention, which MuJoCo 3.6.0 changed.
        All other cameras fall back to the vertical FOV
        (``model.cam_fovy``, square pixels, principal point at the image
        center). Clip planes are
        ``model.vis.map.{znear,zfar} * model.stat.extent``.

        Free camera (``None`` / ``""`` / ``"default"`` / ``"free"``): the same
        view :meth:`get_frame` and :meth:`render` produce for ``cam_id = -1``,
        so the two APIs stay symmetric and the hybrid compositor can composite
        the default view. The pose is reconstructed from
        ``mjv_defaultFreeCamera`` -- MuJoCo's own free-camera defaults, i.e.
        ``model.vis.global_.{azimuth,elevation}`` about ``model.stat.center``
        at ``1.5 * model.stat.extent`` -- and ``K`` from
        ``model.vis.global_.fovy``. That view is a deterministic function of
        the compiled model, so the params describe exactly what the renderer
        draws.

        Holds ``self._lock``. For a named camera it also forward-steps
        kinematics (``mj_forward``, a write to ``mj_data``) so freshly placed
        cameras have a valid pose even before the first ``step()``; the free
        camera is derived from the model alone and needs no such write.

        Args:
            camera_name: a named camera, or a free-camera token (``None`` /
                ``""`` / ``"default"`` / ``"free"``).
            width: image width to compute ``K`` for; ``None`` uses the
                camera's configured resolution (the engine default for the
                free camera). An explicit value must be a positive whole
                number within the offscreen framebuffer cap - the same
                dimension contract :meth:`render` and :meth:`get_frame`
                enforce, so the params always describe a renderable frame.
            height: image height to compute ``K`` for; same contract as
                ``width``.

        Raises:

        """``K`` for a camera declared with explicit MJCF intrinsics, else ``None``.

        MJCF cameras may declare a physical sensor (``sensorsize`` +
        ``focal``/``focalpixel`` + ``principal``/``principalpixel`` +
        ``resolution``). MuJoCo then rasterizes with that intrinsic model -
        ``fovy`` is ignored, pixels may be non-square (``fx != fy``), and the
        principal point moves off the image center - so deriving ``K`` from
        ``fovy`` silently misplaces every unprojected point (~25 cm on a wide
        off-centre camera).

        ``K`` is read back from the view frustum MuJoCo computes for this
        camera - ``mjv_updateCamera`` fills ``mjvScene.camera[0].frustum_*``,
        the exact numbers ``mjr_render`` hands ``glFrustum`` - rather than
        re-derived from ``cam_intrinsic``. The renderer maps that frustum onto
        the full viewport, so at ``near = frustum_near`` and
        ``halfwidth = frustum_width``::

            fx = w * near / (2 * halfwidth)
            fy = h * near / (frustum_top - frustum_bottom)
            cx = w * (halfwidth - frustum_center) / (2 * halfwidth)
            cy = h * frustum_top / (frustum_top - frustum_bottom)

        Reading the frustum is what keeps the principal point on the side of
        the image center MuJoCo actually draws it: the vertical assignment
        differs across the supported version range. MuJoCo 3.6.0 fixed swapped
        vertical frustum bounds for a camera with a principal-point offset, so
        a positive MJCF ``principal`` y-offset moves the principal point DOWN
        the image on MuJoCo <= 3.5 and UP from 3.6 on. A closed form over
        ``cam_intrinsic`` can only match one of the two, and on the other it
        places ``cy`` exactly as far the wrong side of the image center - a
        silent unprojection error of twice the offset (~26 cm of world-point
        error at a 1 m stand-off for a 0.8 mm offset on a 4.8 mm sensor).

        ``frustum_width`` is zero exactly when the camera declares no physical
        sensor: MuJoCo then derives the horizontal extent from the viewport
        aspect ratio, which is the ``fovy`` path.

        the start guards are asking, and the reason they cannot ask about
        liveness. The thread read only distinguishes the two registered phases
        that are still moving from the one that has settled.

        The synchronous recorder registers no thread, so its live phase is
        ``"recording"`` on the flag alone and its ``finalize`` flushes and
        deregisters in one step.

        the recording thread so the ffmpeg pipe doesn't race with policy
        timing jitter. Returns per-camera frame counts and paths.

        Idempotent and safe whichever ``start_cameras_recording*`` variant
        was used:

        * Daemon-thread (``start_cameras_recording``) -> flips
          ``state["running"] = False``, joins the thread, then flushes.
        * Synchronous (``start_cameras_recording_synchronous``) -> no
          thread to join; the ``finalize`` callable returned alongside
          ``on_frame`` is the preferred entry point but
          ``stop_cameras_recording`` works equivalently for callers that
          don't keep the closure handle.

        The returned envelope reports the join outcome. ``Thread.join`` returns
        ``None`` whether or not the thread finished, so the liveness read after
        it is the only thing that tells a stopped recorder from one that
        outlasted :data:`_CAMS_REC_JOIN_TIMEOUT_S` - a ``render`` call blocking
        on a wedged GL context is the ordinary case. That outcome decides all
        three of what happens next:

        A flush that cannot encode at all - no encoder installed - keeps the
        registration for the same reason, so both of this method's failure paths
        leave a buffer that a later call can still write. See
        :meth:`_flush_and_deregister_cameras_recording`.

        * ``status="error"`` with ``stopped=False``, so a caller cannot read
          "success" while frames are still being captured.
        * **Nothing is encoded.** The flush walks each buffer twice (once to
          find the dominant frame shape, once to select it) and a live capture
          loop appending between the two passes makes the encoded clip and the
          reported counts describe different frame lists. An unflushed buffer is
          recoverable; an MP4 encoded from a moving one is not.
        * The recording stays registered, so a later call re-joins that loop
          and flushes it. The registration is also what keeps a second recorder
          from starting on the same cameras, and it keeps doing so after the
          slow ``render`` returns and the loop exits: the start guards read the
          registration rather than the thread, because that settled state still
          holds the frames this refusal promised were recoverable. See

        Returns ``(on_frame, finalize)`` callables instead of spawning a
        daemon thread. The eval driver wires ``on_frame`` into
        :meth:`~strands_robots.simulation.SimEngine.evaluate_benchmark`'s
        new ``on_frame=`` kwarg (#191), and rendering happens on the eval
        thread - eliminating the cross-thread ``mjData`` race the daemon
        recorder hits under multi-threaded eval (Strands ``Agent`` tool
        dispatch under asyncio, where the eval runs on a worker thread
        distinct from the script main).

        Symptoms of the daemon-thread bug this fixes (#191):
        a threaded MuJoCo agent driver measured 2-3% frame
        capture rate vs the programmatic single-thread driver, with
        visible greenish GL clear-colour gradient frames at episode
        boundaries. The synchronous mode trades the daemon thread for a
        per-step render call; the eval thread already holds a warm GL
        context (the renderer is per-thread; the policy loop drives
        ``sim.render`` on its own thread for the policy obs), so no
        warmup loop is needed.

        Caller pattern::

            on_frame, finalize = sim.start_cameras_recording_synchronous(
                cameras=["image", "wrist_image"],

                finalize()

        Args:
            cameras: list of camera names; ``None`` = every camera.
            output_dir: where to write ``{tag}__{cam}.mp4``. Defaults to
                ``$TMPDIR/strands_robots/recordings``. Validated against ``..``
                traversal / backslash / shell metacharacters / symlink; set
                ``STRANDS_ROBOTS_VIDEO_ROOT`` to confine it to a sandbox.
            fps: encoded MP4 frame rate (and target capture rate when
                ``on_frame`` fires more often than ``fps``). Must be a positive
                whole number - the ffmpeg writer refuses anything else, so an
                unusable value is rejected up front instead of surfacing as an
                empty recording that reported success.
            width, height: per-frame size; defaults to the renderer's
                native resolution. An explicit value must be a positive whole
                number.
            name: filename tag (auto-generated UUID prefix when ``None``).
                Validated as a single path component - separators / traversal
                / metacharacters rejected.
            max_frames_per_camera: safety cap on in-memory buffers. Must be a
                positive whole number (``0``/negative would drop every frame).
                Frames beyond the cap are silently dropped (status
                visible via :meth:`get_cameras_recording_status`).

            On success: ``{"status": "success", "content": [{"text": ...},

            that can't reach Python closures can use the daemon-thread

        Four phases, and only one of them is ``[idle]``. ``[recording]`` is a

        expired and the recorder thread actually exiting, where frames can still
        land; ``[unflushed]`` is that window after the thread has gone, holding
        frames no flush has read; and ``[idle]`` means nothing is registered at
        all. The last distinction is the one worth stating: only a flush
        deregisters a recording, so ``[idle]`` promises there is no buffer left
        to encode, and answering it about a settled-but-registered state would
        report captured frames as if they had never existed.
