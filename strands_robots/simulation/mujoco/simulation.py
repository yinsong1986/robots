"""MuJoCo Simulation backend - AgentTool orchestrator + shared state host.

Architecture notes (honest version, see GH #118)

The ``Simulation`` class uses multiple-inheritance to compose four mixins
(``PhysicsMixin``, ``RenderingMixin``, ``RecordingMixin``, ``RandomizationMixin``)
on top of the ``SimEngine`` ABC and the Strands ``AgentTool`` base. The
split keeps each file navigable (physics.py ~1150 lines, rendering.py ~730,
etc.) but the mixin boundaries describe *where code lives*, NOT the
coupling graph.

Every mixin reaches back into this class for the same shared state:

    self._world              - SimWorld handle (model + data + bookkeeping)
    self._lock               - RLock serializing ALL model/data access
    self._mj                 - cached ``mujoco`` module reference
    self._policy_threads     - per-robot Future dict (GH #114)
    self._renderer_tls       - thread-local renderer cache (macOS CGL)
    self._executor           - ThreadPoolExecutor for async policies

AND the cross-cutting helpers:

    self._require_world()              - "is the world live?" guard
    self._require_no_running_policy()  - scene-mutation safety gate
    self._prune_done_futures()         - cleanup of stale Future refs
    self._active_policy_robots()       - introspection + prune

Mixins declare these via ``if TYPE_CHECKING`` stubs so mypy accepts the
attribute lookups. This is NOT a Protocol - mixins are not enforceable;
the contract is *documentary*. The stubs exist so edits to the helpers
in this file propagate to the mixin type-checks without manual sync.

The alternative (extract a ``_SimulationState`` dataclass + pass it to
mixins) was explored and rejected: threading the state through every
method would blow up the diff across every mutation call, and mypy
narrowing of ``state.world._model`` after a ``_require_world(state)``
call does not work any better than narrowing through a bound method
(same limitation that led commit f5c8518 to back out the helper-based
dedup).

So: the split is honest about being for file-size, not for decoupling.

        SIGSEGV waiting to happen. Previously cleanup called

        New order:
          1. Signal every live policy to stop (``policy_running = False``).
