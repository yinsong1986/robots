"""MuJoCo Simulation backend - AgentTool orchestrator + shared state host.

Architecture notes (honest version, see GH #118)

The ``Simulation`` class uses multiple-inheritance to compose four mixins
(``PhysicsMixin``, ``RenderingMixin``, ``RecordingMixin``, ``RandomizationMixin``)
on top of the ``SimEngine`` ABC and the Strands ``AgentTool`` base. The
split keeps each module navigable (:mod:`physics` ~1150 lines,
:mod:`rendering` ~730, etc.) but the mixin boundaries describe *where code lives*, NOT the
coupling graph.

Every mixin reaches back into this class for the same shared state:

    self._world              - SimWorld handle (model + data + bookkeeping)
    self._lock               - RLock serializing ALL model/data access
    self._mj                 - cached ``mujoco`` module reference
    self._policy_threads     - per-robot Future dict (GH #114)
    self._renderer_tls       - thread-local renderer cache (macOS CGL)
    self._executor           - ThreadPoolExecutor for async policies

AND the cross-cutting helpers:

    self._require_world()              - "is the world live?" guard
    self._require_no_running_policy()  - scene-mutation safety gate
    self._prune_done_futures()         - cleanup of stale Future refs
    self._active_policy_robots()       - introspection + prune

Mixins declare these via ``if TYPE_CHECKING`` stubs so mypy accepts the
attribute lookups. This is NOT a Protocol - mixins are not enforceable;
the contract is *documentary*. The stubs exist so edits to the helpers
in this file propagate to the mixin type-checks without manual sync.

The alternative (extract a ``_SimulationState`` dataclass + pass it to
mixins) was explored and rejected: threading the state through every
method would blow up the diff across every mutation call, and mypy
narrowing of ``state.world._model`` after a ``_require_world(state)``
call does not work any better than narrowing through a bound method
(same limitation that led commit f5c8518 to back out the helper-based
dedup).

So: the split is honest about being for file-size, not for decoupling.

Scene mutation and ``self._lock``

A verb that swaps the live scene must hold ``self._lock`` across the swap, not
merely pass ``_require_no_running_policy()``. The two guards cover different
readers: the policy gate refuses a *policy* worker, while the camera-recorder
daemon renders on its own thread and is serialised only by the lock (see
:mod:`strands_robots.simulation.mujoco.rendering`, whose render path takes the
lock precisely because it "is NOT covered by the blanket dispatch lock").

The swap is not atomic either. ``scene_ops.install_compiled_model`` rebinds
``world._model`` and ``world._data`` in two separate assignments, so a reader
that is not excluded can observe a model from after the swap paired with data
from before it -- and MuJoCo dereferences that pair natively, indexing the new
model's body count into the old data's arrays. Holding the lock over the swap is
what makes the pair a reader observes always a matching one. The lock is an
``RLock``, so the acquisition is a reentrant no-op on the dispatch path and the
real guard when the verb is called directly as a Python API.

        Args:
            tool_name: Identifier surfaced to the agent and used as the
                thread-name prefix for the executor.
            default_timestep: Default physics timestep (seconds). Can be
                overridden via ``create_world(timestep=...)``.
            default_width: Default render width (pixels) used when a
                caller does not pass explicit dimensions to ``render``, and
                copied into the ``SimCamera`` entry registered for every
                camera that declares no size of its own. A positive ``int``
                on the shared
                :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error` floor that
                ``add_camera`` applies to a per-camera dimension - the same
                quantity cannot have two domains because of which way in it
                took. The framebuffer *ceiling* stays a render-time check: it
                is a property of the compiled model, not of this call.
            default_height: Default render height (pixels), same domain.
            mesh: Optional mesh-networking hook: an already-started mesh
                client exposing ``.stop()`` (see
                :func:`strands_robots.mesh.init_mesh`), which ``cleanup()``
                stops to detach this Simulation from the peer network before
                tearing down the MuJoCo world. Falsy (``None``, the default)
                keeps the Simulation standalone - all mesh code paths are
                no-ops. A truthy value that is not stoppable (notably
                ``mesh=True``) is rejected with a ``TypeError``: it is not a
                boolean opt-in switch, and the engine has nothing to stop.
                To join a mesh, use ``Robot(name, mode="sim", mesh=True)``,
                which resolves the ``STRANDS_MESH`` kill switch and attaches a
                client. The attribute is plain (not a property), so consumers
                may also attach a client after construction.
            peer_id: Stable identifier the mesh transport uses to
                address this Simulation. Opaque to MuJoCo itself; only
                consulted when ``mesh`` is truthy.
            ros2_bridge: When True, publish per-robot ``joint_states`` and
                camera ``image_raw`` on a ROS 2 domain every ``step``, so
                external ROS 2 nodes can subscribe to the running simulation.
                Requires ``rclpy`` (system ROS 2 / the official docker image);
                an :class:`ImportError` is raised here if it is missing.
                Defaults to False - the sim never touches ROS 2.
            ros2_domain: ROS 2 domain id (``ROS_DOMAIN_ID``) to publish on.
                Only an ``int`` in ``[0, 232]`` names a domain - the RTPS port
                map has no room above that - and a value outside it is refused
                with a :class:`ValueError` during construction whether or not
                ``ros2_bridge`` is set, so a backend that only publishes later
                still rejects it up front. Defaults to ``0``.
            **kwargs: Accepted and ignored, for cross-backend forward
                compatibility. The shared ``create_simulation`` / ``Robot``
                factory forwards one superset of keyword arguments to whichever
                backend is selected; MuJoCo tolerates and drops backend-specific
                kwargs it does not use (e.g. ``num_envs`` / ``device`` meant for
                GPU backends) so an identical call resolves across backends.
                Mirrors ``NewtonSimEngine``'s forward-compatible contract. Note
                they are NOT passed to ``super().__init__()`` (``AgentTool``
                takes no constructor arguments). Robot-setup arguments
                (``robot_name`` / ``robot``) are rejected here rather than
                dropped - a constructor builds an empty engine, so use
                ``Robot("so101", mode="sim")`` or ``add_robot`` instead.
                A name that *misspells* one of the parameters above (e.g.
                ``defualt_timestep``) is likewise rejected rather than dropped:
                no cross-backend call can intend it, and dropping it made the
                requested value silently identical to omitting it.

        ``terrain`` lays down a deterministic heightfield instead of the flat
        ground plane, so a floating-base/locomotion robot is spawned and
        evaluated on non-flat ground: ``"rough"`` = smoothed value-noise bumps,
        ``"stairs"`` = a flight of discrete step plateaus rising along +x,
        ``"pyramid"`` = concentric step plateaus rising toward the centre,
        ``"slope"`` = a constant-grade inclined ramp (see
        :mod:`strands_robots.simulation.terrain`). Only applies when
        ``ground_plane=True``.

        ``difficulty`` scales the terrain's peak elevation (``1.0`` = full
        height, ``<1`` gentler, ``>1`` harsher) - the curriculum knob a
        trainer ramps across resets. It is only meaningful with a ``terrain``;
        ``difficulty != 1.0`` with no ``terrain`` is rejected (it would have no
        effect) and must be a finite value ``> 0``.

        A floating-base robot added to a terrain world is spawned SEATED on
        the local terrain surface (its base is raised by the heightfield
        height beneath it) at ``add_robot`` and on every ``reset()``, rather
        than at the flat-ground keyframe height that would leave its feet
        buried below the raised terrain.

        A world can only be built once: a second call while one is live is
        refused rather than rebuilding under the live scene (``Robot("so101")``
        returns an instance whose world is already created and populated, so this
        refusal is the first thing such a caller meets). The refusal names what
        the live world holds and routes by the arguments actually passed:
        ``timestep`` / ``gravity`` are applied to the live world with
        :meth:`set_timestep` / :meth:`set_gravity`, keeping its contents, while
        ``ground_plane`` / ``terrain`` / ``difficulty`` are compiled in at
        creation and need :meth:`destroy` first. :meth:`reset` applies no
        ``create_world`` parameter - it restores the initial state at the values
        the world was built with - so it is never offered as a way to obtain a
        different world.

        ``timestep`` and ``gravity`` are validated exactly as
        :meth:`set_timestep` / :meth:`set_gravity` validate them - a finite
        ``timestep > 0`` (``0`` is an error, not a silent fallback to the
        engine default) and a 3-element finite ``gravity`` vector (or a real
        scalar taken as the z-component). A value MuJoCo cannot integrate is
        rejected with a structured error instead of being compiled into
        ``model.opt``. ``None`` selects the engine default for either.

        ``ground_plane`` must be a ``bool``: it selects a posture (lay a floor
        or leave the world open), so a non-boolean is refused under the shared
        :func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error` domain rather than
        read by truthiness - ``"false"`` does not lay a floor and ``0`` does
        not omit one.

        """Apply a list of structured ops to the live MjSpec atomically.

        Each op is a small dict. Supported kinds::

            {"op": "add_body",      "parent": "world", "name": "foo", "pos": [0,0,1]}
            {"op": "add_geom",      "body": "foo",     "type": "sphere", "size": [0.1]}
            {"op": "add_site",      "body": "foo",     "name": "tip",    "pos": [0,0,0.2]}
            {"op": "set_body_pos",  "name": "foo",     "pos": [1,0,1]}
            {"op": "set_body_quat", "name": "foo",     "quat": [1,0,0,0]}
            {"op": "delete_body",   "name": "foo"}

        Each op accepts only the keys it reads, and every other key is
        refused::

            add_body       op, parent, name, pos, quat
            add_geom       op, body, type, size, rgba, name, pos, quat
            add_site       op, body, name, pos, size, rgba
            set_body_pos   op, name, pos
            set_body_quat  op, name, quat
            delete_body    op, name

        Rejecting the rest is not pedantry: every field has a fallback default
        (``pos`` the origin, ``quat`` identity, ``type`` ``"box"``, ``parent``
        the worldbody), so a misspelled key would apply that default and report
        success - ``{"op": "set_body_pos", "name": "crate", "position": [...]}``
        would move the body to the origin instead of to the requested pose. The
        error names the op, the unrecognised key, a close match where one
        exists, and the keys that op accepts.

        Every numeric field an op writes is held to the domain the
        scene-construction calls apply to the same buffer: a ``pos`` of exactly
        3 finite components, a ``quat`` of 4, a ``rgba`` of 3 (read as RGB and
        completed with an opaque alpha, exactly as ``add_object(color=...)``
        does) or 4, and a ``size`` of finite components in the count its shape
        consumes. MuJoCo bakes a ``nan``/``inf`` component into the model
        without complaint, so an unchecked one is accepted and only surfaces as
        a poisoned physics state several successful calls later::

            sim.patch_scene_mjcf([{"op": "set_body_pos", "name": "crate",
                                   "pos": [float("nan"), 0, 0.3]}])
            # status=error: set_body_pos: 'pos' must contain finite numbers
            #               (no nan/inf), got [nan, 0, 0.3]

            sim.patch_scene_mjcf([{"op": "set_body_pos", "name": "crate",
                                   "pos": [0.4, 0.9]}])
            # status=error: set_body_pos: 'pos' must be a 3-element vector,
            #               got 2 ([0.4, 0.9])

        The width matters as much as the components: these two ops assign the
        field as a spec attribute rather than passing it as a constructor
        keyword, and MuJoCo reports a mismatch there by dumping a C++ overload
        table that names neither the op nor the field.

        The three ops that CLAIM a name - ``add_body``, ``add_geom`` and
        ``add_site`` - hold it to the same
        :func:`~strands_robots.utils.entity_name_error` domain that
        ``add_object`` / ``add_camera`` / ``add_robot`` apply, so a name one
        door refuses is refused at all of them. Supplying ``""`` or a name
        carrying a NUL leaves an entity this API cannot then address: MuJoCo
        reads a name only up to the first NUL, so ``{"op": "add_body", "name":
        "a\x00b"}`` used to report success while compiling the body as ``a`` -
        ``list_bodies`` showed only ``a``, and a later op that genuinely asked
        for ``a`` was refused as a repeated name the caller never used. An
        empty ``add_geom`` name compiled an unnamed geom, which
        ``set_geom_properties(geom_name=...)`` cannot reach at all. Omitting
        ``name`` on ``add_geom`` is unaffected and still produces an unnamed
        geom, which is legal MJCF; the three ops that instead LOOK a name UP
        (``set_body_pos`` / ``set_body_quat`` / ``delete_body``) are unchanged,
        because a name that addresses nothing is honestly absent there and
        those ops already say so.

        The whole batch is applied, then the spec is recompiled once. If any
        op fails, the batch is rejected and the world is rolled back to its
        pre-patch state (from a deep copy of the spec). Use this for fast
        iterative edits; use ``replace_scene_mjcf`` when you need to express
        MJCF elements not covered by the supported op vocabulary.

        Three conditions reach this message and they have different remedies, so
        it diagnoses which one it is instead of reporting them all as a bad name:

        * The registry does not know ``requested`` - a typo or an unknown robot.
          Names the closest sim-loadable registry keys via
          :func:`close_match_hint` so the caller can fix it in place without a
          discovery round-trip. The pool is deliberately the ``mode="sim"``
          listing rather than the whole registry: a suggestion this engine
          cannot spawn sends the caller straight back here, and the registry
          holds hardware-only entries close enough to be suggested (the sole
          suggestion offered for ``earthrover`` was ``hope_jr``, which is itself
          hardware-only, so the one remedy on offer reproduced the same
          refusal). ``close_match_hint`` already drops a suggestion identical to
          ``requested`` for the same reason - it carries no information and
          displaces a real one out of the three slots.
        * The registry knows ``requested`` and the entry declares a hardware
          backend and no simulation asset - a real robot strands drives over
          LeRobot that has no model to load. The name is already correct, so
          spelling suggestions are the wrong advice here too; names the hardware
          entry point instead, the way
          :func:`~strands_robots.robot.Robot` already answers a leader-arm name
          with the teleoperator entry point rather than the registry listing.
        * The registry knows ``requested`` and its model XML is simply not on
          disk. Here the name is already correct, so spelling suggestions are
          the wrong advice - ``difflib`` ranks an exact match first, so this was
          the one case that got told "Did you mean: <the name it just
          refused>". Names the asset path the resolver looked for and the

        Instead of replacing the entire world model, this method merges the
        robot's bodies, actuators, assets, and sensors into the existing scene
        XML.  This preserves previously-created world state (gravity, objects,
        cameras, other robots).

        That preservation covers the scene's DYNAMIC state, not just its
        contents: an arm already in the world keeps the pose it is in and the
        actuator setpoints holding it there, an object stays where it settled or
        was carried to, a latched ``apply_force`` wrench persists, and the clock
        keeps counting. Only the robot being added is placed at a defined
        configuration - its ``keyframe`` pose, or the zero configuration - so
        composing a scene incrementally cannot undo what has already happened in
        it. Use :meth:`reset` to return the whole world to its initial state.

        ``name`` is the instance label used to address this robot later
        (``run_policy(robot_name=...)``, ``get_robot_state``, etc.). It is
        OPTIONAL: when omitted (``None``, or ``""``) it is auto-derived from
        ``data_config`` (or the URDF filename), with a numeric suffix appended
        if that label is already taken -- so ``add_robot(data_config="so101")``
        twice yields ``so101`` and ``so101_2`` instead of erroring. Any other
        value must be a ``str`` containing no NUL: those two are the documented
        derive-a-label short form, while another falsy value (``0``, ``[]``)
        would take the same branch and report success under a label that was
        never asked for, and a non-string label keys the registry with a value
        the agent-tool surface - where a name arrives as JSON - cannot
        address.

        ``keyframe`` (name ``str`` or index ``int``) spawns the robot in a
        canonical pose declared by a ``<keyframe>`` in its source model
        (e.g. panda ``"home"``) instead of the all-zero configuration, and that
        state is restored by ``reset()``. The keyed actuator command is applied
        with the pose, so a gravity-loaded arm HOLDS its home configuration
        instead of sagging out of it on the first step. An unknown keyframe is a
        hard error naming the available keyframes; ``None`` (default) keeps the
        zero pose.

        A ``name``/``data_config`` that resolves to no model is reported as an
        actionable error naming the requested robot, offering close-match
        suggestions and pointing at ``list_urdfs`` (plus the
        ``data_config=``/``urdf_path=`` options) -- not a dead-end "supply a
        model source". The bare model-source message is kept only when no
        ``name`` was supplied at all.

        Resolving the model from ``name`` is a DEPRECATED fallback, and the
        success message carries a ``Warning:`` line naming the ``data_config=``
        form to use instead. That notice belongs to the call that used the
        fallback and to no other: it is not reported on a later call that
        resolved its model correctly, including when the deprecated call it
        came from failed.

        A model source that is SUPPLIED but empty (``urdf_path=""`` /
        ``data_config=""``) is refused naming THAT parameter, rather than read
        as omitted. Read by truthiness the two were indistinguishable, so an
        empty path fell through to the name lookup and got the message above -
        close-match suggestions for a name the caller never asked to resolve,
        and advice to pass the very kwarg they had passed - byte-identical to
        what supplying no source at all returns. One whitespace character away
        (``urdf_path=" "``) the diagnosis was already correct ("File not
        found"), which is the shape an empty value gets now too.
        :meth:`register_urdf` refuses an empty ``urdf_path`` the same way.

        ``position`` (3 elements) and ``orientation`` (4-element wxyz quaternion)
        are validated up front: a wrong-length, non-numeric, or non-finite
        (nan/inf) vector returns an actionable ``{"status": "error"}`` and
        leaves the simulation unchanged, rather than baking a degenerate pose
        into the robot's base transform. NumPy scalar components are accepted.

        ``position`` OFFSETS the model's own authored root pose rather than
        replacing it: it is written as the attach frame's translation, which
        MuJoCo composes with the ``pos`` the model's root body declares. A
        ground-bolted arm declares ``pos="0 0 0"``, so for those the offset IS
        the world position - but a locomotion model is authored standing, and
        ``position=[0, 0, 0.4]`` on a Unitree Go2 (base ``pos`` ``z=0.445``)
        compiles its base at ``z=0.845``. This differs from
        :meth:`add_object`, whose ``position`` does place its body at exactly
        that world point. The returned message reports the MEASURED world
        position of the robot's root body, and names the request and the
        model's own offset beside it whenever the two differ, so a spawn that
        did not land where it was asked is visible in the result instead of
        having to be measured with :meth:`get_body_state`.

        source joint's short name mapped to its qpos slice, and each source
        actuator's short name mapped to its keyed ``(ctrl, act)`` pair -- or
        ``(None, None, error_result)`` when the source model cannot be compiled
        or the keyframe name/index is unknown (the error names the available
        keyframes so the caller can fix it).

        A MuJoCo ``<key>`` pairs a pose with the actuator command that HOLDS
        that pose, and ``mj_resetDataKeyframe`` -- MuJoCo's own definition of
        what a keyframe restores -- writes both. Reading ``key_qpos`` alone
        leaves a gravity-loaded arm standing at its home pose while every
        actuator is commanded to the zero configuration, so the first step
        drives it off home: the pose is not self-holding, which is the whole
        point of a canonical home. 28 of the 31 built-in registry robots that
        ship a ``<keyframe>`` declare a non-zero ``ctrl`` in it.

        The keyed command is captured VERBATIM and never classified by actuator
        type. The MJCF author chose those numbers for those actuators, so a
        servo's setpoint, a motor's torque and a stateful actuator's activation
        each carry across as whatever quantity their own actuator reads -- the
        same reason ``_snapshot_scene_state`` carries ``ctrl``/``act`` as one
        pair per named actuator on the eject path.

        Not read here, because a per-robot apply cannot own them:

        * ``qvel`` -- the robot-scoped reset that runs immediately before the
          apply (:meth:`_reset_robot_to_reference`) zeroes it deliberately, so
          that a freshly added robot starts from a defined configuration and
          "callers that want a pre-settled pose call step()". Spawning a robot
          already in motion is a different contract, and no built-in registry
          keyframe declares a non-zero ``qvel``.
        * ``time`` and the mocap pools -- world-scope buffers with no slice that
          belongs to one robot. :meth:`reset` owns the clock.

        configuration, leaving the rest of the world untouched.

        A freshly added robot needs a defined starting configuration - the
        recompile that merged it in leaves its new joints at whatever the
        compiler initialized them to. ``mj_resetData`` supplies one, but it
        supplies it for the WHOLE world: every other robot's pose and actuator
        setpoints, every settled object's position, latched wrenches and the
        clock all go back to their reference values too. On a scene that is
        being built up incrementally - the documented way to compose one - that
        turns "add a robot" into "rewind the scene", which is the opposite of
        what :meth:`add_robot` promises its caller.

        Scoping the reset to the robot being added keeps both halves true: the
        new arm starts from a known configuration and nothing else in the world
        moves.

        Actuator setpoints are deliberately NOT this function's business. A
        freshly added robot's ``ctrl``/``act`` entries are new, and defining a
        new entry is the recompile's job -- ``_recompile_preserving_state``
        zeroes the tail its positional state transfer leaves undefined, before
        anything reads it. Repeating that here by iterating ``actuator_ids``
        would be both narrower and less safe, because the two answer different
        questions: ``actuator_ids`` is ownership -- which robot may command an
        actuator -- whereas the tail is a memory fact about which entries the
        positional transfer never wrote. ``mj_checkCtrl`` reads the whole buffer,
        so the obligation is positional and unconditional, while ownership is
        derived and not guaranteed to cover the tail:
        :func:`~strands_robots.simulation.mujoco.scene_ops.robot_owned_actuator_ids`
        returns an empty list for an actuator that is neither namespace-prefixed
        nor joint-driven -- the fixed tendon that couples a gripper's fingers,
        say, whose transmission is gated out of the driven-joint match by design.
        Sourcing initialization from it would make this method silently wrong
        wherever ownership is not a complete cover.

        Args:
            robot: The robot to reset. Its ``joint_ids`` are the post-recompile
                ids resolved by

        Separate from :meth:`list_robots` (which returns ``list[str]`` for
        the SimEngine ABC) because the dispatcher needs a dict-shaped
        response for user display.

        ``Position`` is the base pose read from ``mjData`` -- where the robot
        *is* -- not the ``add_robot(position=...)`` request that put it there.
        ``SimRobot.position`` holds only that request, and the physics never
        writes it, so reporting it described every robot by its spawn argument
        in two ways at once. ``position`` is the attach FRAME's translation and
        MuJoCo COMPOSES it with the model's own authored root pose rather than
        replacing it (see :meth:`_robot_root_world_position`), so 29 of the 51
        single-root robots in the built-in registry never stood where the
        request named even at ``t=0``: a ``jvrc`` asked for ``z=0`` has its
        pelvis at ``z=1.4``, a ``unitree_g1`` at ``z=0.793``, a ``unitree_go2``
        at ``z=0.445``. And 32 of the 63 have a floating base, so any robot
        that walks, drives, flies or falls kept reporting its spawn pose for
        the rest of the session -- a 0 mm reading for the displacement that
        *is* the success signal of a locomotion rollout.

        :meth:`add_robot` already reports the measured placement through
        :meth:`_describe_robot_placement`, so the two calls contradicted each
        other for the same robot in the same session. This method reads the
        pose directly instead of reusing that helper: the helper also names the
        request and the model's root offset beside the measurement, which is
        the useful comparison at add time but becomes a false label later --
        after the robot has moved, ``measured - requested`` is accumulated
        motion, not a "model root offset".

        A model with several root bodies (12 in the registry: an ``aloha``
        attaches two arm bases, an ``rby1`` six) has no one base pose to name,
        so its line keeps reporting the requested attach frame and says so
        rather than implying a measurement. Five of those twelve (``apollo``,
        ``lekiwi``, ``open_duck_mini``, ``stretch``, ``stretch3``) do have a
        floating base, so their line can still age; the label is what stops it
        from being read as a live reading.

        Thread-safety: acquires ``self._lock`` while reading the position
        arrays, the same torn-read guard :meth:`get_observation` and

            ``{"status", "content": [{"text"}, {"json": {"bodies": [...]}}]}``.
            ``bodies`` is the ordered list of body names; the ``text`` block
            mirrors it for human display. When ``robot_name`` is given the
            json also carries ``"gripper_body"`` -- the best-guess gripper/
            end-effector mount (a body one of whose *name components* is one of
            :data:`~strands_robots.simulation.ik.GRIPPER_BODY_HINTS`, the set
            every backend reads: ``gripper``, ``hand``, ``jaw``, ``ee`` or
            ``tool``), or ``null`` if none
            matches. Hints match components rather than bare substrings, so a
            short hint cannot fire inside an unrelated word: a ``knee`` or a
            drive ``wheel`` is not an end-effector because ``ee`` occurs in its
            name.

        The ``size`` argument is the **full extent in meters** along each local
        axis -- *not* MuJoCo's native half-extent. It is halved internally when
        the geom is compiled, so a box created with ``size=[0.05, 0.05, 0.05]``
        is a 5 cm cube (MuJoCo stores ``geom_size == [0.025, 0.025, 0.025]``).
        Per-shape ``size`` semantics (all values are full extents / diameters in
        meters):

        * ``box`` / ``ellipsoid``: ``[x, y, z]`` full edge lengths per axis.
        * ``sphere``: ``size[0]`` is the diameter (``size[1:]`` ignored).
        * ``cylinder``: ``size[0]`` diameter, ``size[2]`` full height
          (``size[1]`` ignored).
        * ``capsule``: ``size[0]`` diameter, ``size[2]`` the length of the
          cylindrical section (``size[1]`` ignored). The two hemispherical caps
          add ``size[0] / 2`` at each end, so the object's total height is
          ``size[2] + size[0]`` -- a 0.9 m capsule 0.05 m across stands 0.95 m
          tall.
        * ``plane``: ``size[0]`` / ``size[1]`` are visual half-widths; planes are
          infinite for collision and are forced static.
        * ``mesh``: ``size`` is ignored -- the asset's own units define the
          extent (requires ``mesh_path``).

        The success text describes the geometry that **compiled**, read back off
        the geom, never the request. The two are the same number only for a
        ``box`` or an ``ellipsoid``; for every other shape the request holds
        components the geom does not carry (see the table above), and a report
        that echoed them stated an extent the object does not have.

        A free (non-static) body rests on a horizontal support at
        ``rest_z = support_top + size_z / 2`` -- e.g. a 5 cm cube on a table
        whose top is at ``z = 0.75`` settles with its body origin at
        ``z = 0.775``. Assuming half-extent makes objects look like they "sink
        into" a support when the rest height was simply mis-computed.

        On a ``create_world(terrain=...)`` world the local ground beneath
        ``(x, y)`` is *elevated* (up to ``TERRAIN_ELEVATION * difficulty`` above
        ``z = 0``), so this flat-support formula -- which assumes a support at
        ``z = 0`` -- leaves an object spawned there buried in the heightfield
        (it then sinks through instead of resting on the surface). Query the
        local surface with :meth:`get_ground_height` and add the shape's rest
        offset (e.g. ``size_z / 2`` for a box) to place the object on the
        terrain: ``position=[x, y, get_ground_height(x, y)["content"][1]["json"]["height"] + size_z / 2]``.

        Args:
            name: Unique object name. Its geom is injected as ``"<name>_geom"``.
                Must be a non-empty ``str`` that contains no NUL: an empty name
                is MuJoCo's own sentinel for an unnamed body (so
                ``get_body_state`` could not find the object afterwards), a NUL
                truncates the name the model compiles under while the registry
                keeps the full string, and a non-string name is not addressable
                through the agent-tool surface, where a name arrives as JSON.
            shape: ``"box"``, ``"sphere"``, ``"cylinder"``, ``"capsule"``,
                ``"ellipsoid"``, ``"plane"``, or ``"mesh"``.
            position: World position ``[x, y, z]`` of the body origin (default
                origin).
            orientation: wxyz quaternion (default identity). Any non-unit value is fine -- the magnitude is ignored -- but one whose norm rounds to zero describes no rotation and is refused rather than silently applied as identity (:func:`~strands_robots.utils.coerce_orientation_quaternion`).
            size: Full extents in meters per the per-shape table above. Defaults
                to ``[0.05, 0.05, 0.05]`` (a 5 cm box) when omitted. Must carry
                every component the shape consumes -- 3 for ``box`` /
                ``ellipsoid`` / ``cylinder`` / ``capsule``, at least 1 for
                ``sphere`` / ``plane`` -- and at most 3 in total. A partial
                vector (``size=[0.5]`` on a box) is rejected rather than
                completed from a backend default, because a completed vector
                compiles a differently-sized object while reporting success.
                Every consumed component must be > 0; a non-positive extent is
                rejected.
            color: ``[r, g, b]`` or ``[r, g, b, a]`` in 0..1 (default mid-grey).
                An RGB triple is completed with an opaque alpha -- the one
                component the geom's rgba row defines a default for. Any other
                component count, including an empty vector, is rejected rather
                than completed from the backend default, because a completed
                colour paints a surface the caller never asked for while
                reporting success.
            mass: Body mass in kg for dynamic objects (default 0.1); must be a
                finite number > 0 (the same domain ``set_body_properties``
                enforces). Ignored when ``is_static``.
            is_static: Fix the body in the world. ``None`` (the default)
                means unspecified: ``shape="plane"`` resolves it to True, every
                other shape to False. A plane cannot be dynamic, so an explicit
                ``is_static=False`` there is refused rather than overridden --
                which is why the default is ``None`` and not ``False``. A
                supplied value must be a boolean, because it selects a posture:
                ``0`` is that same refused ``False`` and must not reach the
                override instead of the refusal, and ``"false"`` reads as truthy
                and would weld a body asked to be dynamic.
            mesh_path: Mesh asset path; required and only used when
                ``shape="mesh"``. The asset defines the geom's extent, and
                MuJoCo collides a mesh geom as its **convex hull** -- not as the
                triangles that render. For a convex asset the two coincide; for
                a concave one (a room shell, a tray, a shelf, a bowl) the hull
                fills every cavity, so an object dropped "inside" rests on the
                filled hull and a camera still shows the open interior. To get
                load-bearing concave geometry, decompose the asset into convex
                parts and add one mesh object per part. The success text names
                the hull for this reason.
            material: Optional MuJoCo material for the object's geom, given as
                a mapping of material attribute to value. The accepted keys are
                ``builtin``, ``reflectance``, ``rgb1``, ``rgb2``, ``shininess``,
                ``specular``, ``texdim``, ``texrepeat`` and ``texture``
                (:data:`~strands_robots.simulation.mujoco.spec_builder.MATERIAL_KEYS`
                is the single source of truth). A key outside that vocabulary is
                refused - with a "did you mean" suggestion and the accepted list
                - rather than dropped, and so is ``material={}``, which would
                otherwise report success having compiled the default material.
                ``rgb1`` / ``rgb2`` / ``texdim`` only colour or size a
                procedural texture, so passing one without ``builtin`` is
                refused too: the texture they configure would never be
                generated. ``None`` (default) leaves the geom on the flat
                ``color`` rgba.

        Returns:
            Agent-tool status dict. ``{"status": "success", ...}`` on success;
            ``{"status": "error", ...}`` when no world exists, a policy is
            running, ``name`` is not a usable entity name (see above), the name
            is taken, ``position``/``orientation``/``color``/
            ``size`` contains a non-finite (``nan``/``inf``) or non-numeric
            element or ``position``/``orientation``/``color`` is the wrong length
            (3 / 4 / 3-or-4), ``size`` has a non-positive extent or a component
            count the shape cannot consume, ``mass`` is not a finite number > 0
            for a dynamic object, ``shape="mesh"`` is missing ``mesh_path``, or
            the recompile fails.

        Example:
            >>> sim.add_object("cube", shape="box", size=[0.05, 0.05, 0.05])  # 5 cm cube
            >>> # on a table whose top is at z=0.75, the cube rests at z=0.775

        ``material`` (optional): a visual material/texture spec. When ``None``
        the object renders with the flat ``color`` rgba (unchanged behaviour).
        When set, a real MuJoCo material/texture is attached so the surface can
        be matte (``{"specular": 0, "shininess": 0}``) or carry an image
        texture (``{"texture": "/abs/path.png", "texrepeat": [2, 2]}``) or a
        procedural builtin (``{"builtin": "checker", "rgb1": [...], "rgb2":
        [...]}``). See :meth:`SpecBuilder._build_material` for the full schema;
        an invalid texture path or unknown builtin fails loudly (no silent
        fallback to flat plastic). Only the keys in
        :data:`~strands_robots.simulation.mujoco.spec_builder.MATERIAL_KEYS`
        are accepted -- a misspelled or unsupported key (``"rgb_1"``,
        ``"roughness"``) is rejected rather than dropped, because a dropped key
        renders the default glossy surface while still reporting success.

        ``[w, x, y, z]`` quaternion. Either may be omitted to leave that
        component unchanged.

        Two paths, transparent to the caller:

        * **Dynamic objects** (``is_static=False``, created with a freejoint)
          are moved cheaply by writing ``data.qpos`` + a forward pass. The
          object is placed **at rest** at the new pose (its freejoint velocity
          is zeroed), consistent with ``add_object`` and ``reset``.
        * **Static objects** (``is_static=True``, welded to the worldbody with
          no DOF) cannot be moved through ``data.qpos``; they are repositioned
          by editing the spec body pose and recompiling the scene (preserving
          other joints' state), just like ``add_object`` / ``remove_object``.

        ``position`` must be a 3-element vector and ``orientation`` a 4-element
        wxyz quaternion whose norm does not round to zero; each must contain only
        finite real numbers. A zero quaternion describes no rotation, and MuJoCo
        substitutes identity for one without complaint, so the success text would
        echo an orientation the body does not have. The vector
        itself may be a list, a tuple or a NumPy array (pose arithmetic produces
        arrays), and its elements may be NumPy scalars. A wrong-length,
        non-numeric, or nan/inf pose is rejected up front rather than raising a
        bare ``ValueError`` past the tool-result contract or silently writing a
        non-finite value into ``data.qpos`` (which ``mj_forward`` would propagate
        through the whole physics state). "Supplied" means "not ``None``": an
        empty vector is a wrong-length request, not an omission, so it is
        rejected instead of leaving the component unchanged under a success
        result. The returned text names the components actually applied.

        Returns ``status="error"`` if the object is unknown, the pose is
        invalid, or the static-body recompile fails - it never reports success
        without actually moving the object.

        """Add a camera to the scene (MJCF ``<camera>`` injection).

        Naming: ``add_object(name="X", ...)`` injects its geom as
        ``"X_geom"`` in MJCF, so cameras share the name table only with
        other cameras and body names - not with object geoms. A name this
        engine already registered is rejected upfront; a name the loaded
        scene's MJCF declares is invisible to that check (``load_scene``
        replaces the registry, not the MJCF) and is refused by the compiler
        instead - either way the add is refused and the camera the scene
        already had keeps its own pose.

        Orientation: ``target`` is baked into the camera's ``xyaxes``
        attribute so the rendered view looks at that point (not just
        forward-facing). Degenerate cases (target == position) error.

        Mounting (``parent_body``): when set to a body name (e.g. a robot's
        gripper such as ``"so101/gripper"``), the camera is attached TO that
        body and rides along with it -- this is how a realistic wrist/gripper
        camera is modelled for SO101/SO100-style data collection. In this
        mode ``position`` and ``target`` are in the body's LOCAL frame. Call
        ``list_bodies`` (optionally with ``robot_name``) to discover valid
        mount points before placing a camera; robot bodies are namespaced
        ``<robot>/<body>`` (e.g. ``so101/gripper`` is the SO101 wrist mount).

        Validation: ``name`` must be a non-empty ``str`` containing no NUL; must
        be a camera token (letters, digits, ``_`` or ``-``, opening on a letter
        or a digit) optionally scoped to one robot as ``<robot>/<camera>``, which
        is how a wrist camera is named on a namespaced robot
        (:func:`~strands_robots.utils.scoped_camera_name_error` - the name is the
        key the mesh topic, the S3 object key and the
        ``observation.images.<name>`` dataset feature are built from, and each of
        those reads other punctuation as structure); and
        must not be one of the free-camera routing tokens
        (:data:`~strands_robots.utils.FREE_CAMERA_TOKENS` - ``None``, ``""``,
        ``"default"``, ``"free"``). ``render``/``render_depth``/``get_frame``
        resolve every one of them to the free camera by an explicit token check,
        so a camera created under any of them could never be rendered from even
        though it is registered, compiled into the model and listed by
        ``list_cameras``; a non-string name is additionally not addressable
        through the agent-tool surface. All three parts of the name rule come from
        the shared :func:`~strands_robots.utils.camera_name_error`, which every
        backend's ``add_camera`` reads, so the rule and its order are stated
        once: the name is judged BEFORE any value, because a reserved name is
        the one fault no change of value can clear. The Newton backend refuses
        the same set because it routes the same tokens; the Isaac backend does
        not route them - its ``get_frame`` looks the name up directly - so it
        passes ``routes_free_camera_tokens=False`` and ``"default"`` there is an
        ordinary camera name. ``position`` and ``target``
        must each be 3 finite numbers (a list, tuple or NumPy array; NumPy
        scalar elements accepted). Omit a vector to take its default - an empty
        vector is a wrong-length request and is rejected rather than silently
        placing the camera at the default pose. ``fov`` must be a finite angle in ``(0, 180)``
        degrees; and ``width``/``height`` must be positive ints within the
        offscreen framebuffer cap (same bounds ``render`` enforces). Invalid
        values are rejected here at config time with an actionable error rather
        than deferring an uncaught ``TypeError`` (non-numeric), a silently
        degenerate camera (``nan``/``inf`` baked into ``xyaxes``), or a cryptic
        spec-recompile / GL failure to the first render.

        * :meth:`list_policies_running` answered "No policies running.",

          That is the affirmative lie the surrounding stop branches are
          commented against, reached through the population instead of the

        :meth:`stop_policy` was the one surface that read the per-robot claim as

          pointers to the old arrays will segfault when it next calls
          ``mj_step``. Hard-fail.

        * ``robot_name="..."`` - **per-robot scope**. Used by actions that
          are safe to run while *other* robots' policies are active
          (start_policy on the same robot, stop_policy, etc.). Policies on
          different robots can execute concurrently because MuJoCo physics
          is serialized by ``self._lock`` and each robot writes to a
          disjoint slice of ``data.ctrl[]``.

        :meth:`start_policy` submits - a blocking :meth:`run_policy` registers
        nothing. So every mutation listed above was refused during a
        Future-backed rollout and *accepted* during a blocking one, on a scene
        the blocking rollout was stepping, while
        :meth:`list_policies_running` reported that rollout in flight for both.
        That is the same two-sources drift #2833 closed for the reporting
        surfaces, reached through the gate instead of the report - and the
        consequence here is the segfault this docstring already warns about

        The rollout's own driving thread is exempt, on the reasoning that makes
        ``self._lock`` an ``RLock`` (see "Scene mutation and ``self._lock``" in
        the module docstring): a rollout mutates the scene itself between
        episodes - :class:`~strands_robots.simulation.policy_runner.PolicyRunner`
        calls ``sim.reset()`` at the top of each one - and the driver racing
        itself is not the hazard the gate is written against. The claim is
        recorded by :meth:`_drive_rollout`, the body both entry points share, so
        it names the thread that actually steps the physics in either shape.

        synchronized control loop, recording ALL robots into ONE merged frame
        per timestep.

        This is the correct path for concurrent multi-robot data collection
        (e.g. two SO-100 arms doing a handover, or a bimanual setup). Unlike
        launching two independent ``start_policy`` threads - which each step
        physics and call ``add_frame`` separately, so the shared recorder
        receives interleaved single-robot frames (B4) - this loop:

        1. Observes every robot (joints) and renders all cameras ONCE.
        2. Queries each robot's policy for its action.
        3. Applies every robot's ctrl writes, then steps physics ONCE.
        4. Records ONE frame containing ALL robots' prefixed state/action
           (``alice__shoulder_pan`` ...) plus all camera images.

        So a 2-robot dataset has both arms co-observed in every frame - usable
        for bimanual / multi-agent policy training.

        Args:
            policies: Mapping ``{robot_name: Policy}``. Each robot must exist in
                the scene. Order defines the state/action column order.
            instructions: Either a single instruction string applied to all
                robots, or a ``{robot_name: instruction}`` mapping whose keys
                must name robots driven by this call (i.e. keys of ``policies``);
                a robot omitted from the mapping gets an empty instruction. A
                key matching no driven robot is rejected rather than silently
                dropped. The frame's recorded task is the first robot's
                instruction (LeRobot stores one task per frame).
            duration: Episode length in seconds (steps = duration x freq).
                Used only when no ``n_steps`` / ``max_steps`` is given. Must be
                a finite positive number; a non-positive, non-finite, or
                non-numeric value is a caller error, not a zero-step rollout
                reported as a success.
            control_frequency: Target Hz for policy action queries / physics.
                Must be a positive number.
            action_horizon: How many actions to consume from each policy's
                returned chunk before re-querying it (open-loop chunk
                execution, mirrors ``run_policy``). Either a single int applied
                to all robots, or a ``{robot_name: horizon}`` mapping for
                per-robot control. The effective per-robot chunk length is
                ``max(action_horizon, policy.actions_per_step)`` (see
                ``strands_robots.policies.resolve_chunk_length``): a
                chunk-emitting policy keeps its full trained chunk even when
                ``action_horizon`` is smaller, identical to ``run_policy``, so a
                model is never re-queried out-of-distribution in one driver but
                not the other. A robot's policy is only re-queried when its
                action queue drains - so an expensive VLA emitting a 30-action
                chunk with ``action_horizon=30`` runs inference ~once per 30
                steps instead of every step. Physics still advances ONE step per
                loop iteration, keeping all robots phase-aligned regardless of
                their individual re-query cadence. Every horizon must be a
                positive integer - the same guard ``run_policy`` /
                ``start_policy`` / ``eval_policy`` enforce - and mapping keys
                must name robots driven by this call; a robot omitted from the
                mapping uses the default horizon (8).
            n_steps: Alternate horizon in steps (overrides duration when set).
                Honoured exactly: the loop runs this many synchronized steps,
                and records this many merged frames when a recording is
                attached. It is not re-derived as ``int(duration x
                control_frequency)`` from the ``n_steps / control_frequency``
                duration, which truncates at any rate the count does not
                divide evenly (``29`` at 50 Hz, ``1`` at 49 Hz).
            max_steps: Legacy alias for ``n_steps``.

        Returns:
            Standard status dict with per-robot step counts.

        The rollout and eval actions take ``video=`` as a dict, while the schema
        publishes the flat spellings a model can emit (``output_path``, ``fps``,
        ``camera_name``). This consumes the flat keys it can honor and leaves the
        rest in *payload* for the router's unknown-key check.

        Runs before validation, so a key removed here is never reported as

        Restating it is what let the mirror model the three flat keys as accepted
        for all four folding actions while the router accepted a bare
        ``camera_name`` on ``run_policy`` alone - so an example naming the video
        camera for an eval rollout passed the mirror and was refused at runtime,
        which is the dropped-envelope no-op the mirror exists to prevent.

        ``camera_name`` is only folded when paired with a path, because the name
        is shared with :meth:`render` and there is nothing to attach it to

        Policy-provider kwargs are nested under ``policy_config`` (never
        top-level) so the dispatcher stays backend-agnostic.

        Resolution is ``getattr`` by name with no allowlist, so the router is
        deliberately wider than ``tool_spec.json``'s ``action`` enum: the enum is
        the curated agent-facing subset, and a public method absent from it stays
        callable from Python through this method. That breadth is intended, and
        it is accounted for: every public method of this class is either
        published in that enum or recorded as deliberately Python-only, and one
        that is neither fails the backend's tool-spec guards. So a newly added
        method cannot become dispatchable-but-unadvertised in silence, and a
        deliberate omission stays distinguishable from an oversight.

        That width no longer reaches an agent. Both agent-facing entry points
        (:meth:`__call__` and :meth:`stream`) refuse a non-enum action first,
        via :meth:`_unpublished_action_error`, so what a model can invoke is
        exactly what it was advertised - the resolution of #2093. Calling this
        method directly bypasses that refusal deliberately: it is the Python
        path, and the width is what makes it useful there.

        Concurrency (GH #116): nulling ``self._world`` while a policy worker
        thread is still inside ``mj_step(world._model, world._data)`` is a
        SIGSEGV waiting to happen. Previously cleanup called
        ``executor.shutdown(wait=False)`` right after setting
        ``self._world = None``, which meant the worker could still be
        holding stale pointers to freed arrays. The
        ``policy_running = False`` flag was flipped but never awaited.

        New order:
          1. Signal every live policy to stop (``policy_running = False``).
          2. Await each outstanding Future with a bounded timeout - the
             ``on_frame`` hook sees the flag at the top of its next call
             and raises ``CooperativeStop`` which short-circuits run_policy.
          3. Any Future still not-done after the timeout: we log a warning
             and proceed - at that point the worker is wedged somewhere
             outside MuJoCo and a stale-pointer segfault is the lesser evil
             than hanging the host process on exit.
          4. Only AFTER workers have unwound do we null ``self._world``
             and tear down renderers / the viewer / the executor. The
             nulling itself happens under ``self._lock`` (bounded acquire):
             an analytic motion primitive runs on its caller's thread rather
             than through the executor, so the join in step 2 cannot cover
             it and the lock is the only thing that keeps the handoff from
             landing inside one of its control ticks.

        Args:
            policy_stop_timeout: Seconds to wait per active policy future - a
                positive finite number, validated by the same rule every other
                span of time is (:func:`strands_robots.utils.positive_finite_number_error`).
                ``None`` (default) uses ``_DEFAULT_POLICY_STOP_TIMEOUT`` (5s).
                Set to a small value in tests that want fast teardown. A budget
                the join cannot measure - ``0``, a negative value, ``nan``,
                ``inf`` or a non-real - is reported and resolved to that same
                default rather than refused: every one of them expires the wait
                before its first check, and abandoning a live worker is the
                stale-pointer window step 2 exists to close, so the safe budget
                is the honest reading of "no usable preference". Teardown always
                completes; see :func:`_resolve_policy_stop_timeout`.

        Note:
            Binding every name at module scope is not enough to make this
            callable from a finalizer during interpreter shutdown: CPython sets
            a module's globals to ``None`` before destroying the objects that
            module built, so at that point *module-scope* names are exactly the
            ones that have gone. This method reads four of its own, and
            delegates into four more modules that read theirs, so the first one
            reached raises ``AttributeError`` and the ``__del__`` safety net
            releases nothing at all - reported only as a warning naming the
            interpreter rather than anything the caller can act on. A caller
            who never calls this method (or uses the context manager) is
            covered by :func:`_release_live_engines` instead, which runs while
            the import system is intact. A function-local import here is still
            wrong, for the same reason it was.
