"""Unified Robot factory - convenience layer over ``strands_robots.simulation``
and ``strands_robots.hardware_robot``.

Provides:
    - ``Robot("so100")`` → returns a simulation by default (safe)
    - ``Robot("so100", mode="real")`` → explicit real hardware
    - ``Robot("so100", mode="auto")`` → auto-detects sim/real
    - ``list_robots()``  → what's available

Environment Variables:
    STRANDS_ROBOT_MODE: Override mode detection ("sim", "real", "auto").
        Case-insensitive; surrounding whitespace ignored.
    STRANDS_MESH: Opt a bare ``Robot()`` into the Zenoh mesh. Mesh is OFF
        unless asked for: only "true"/"1"/"yes" turns it ON, and unset or
        "false" leaves it OFF. An explicit ``mesh=True``/``mesh=False``
        kwarg wins over this default, except that "false" is a hard kill
        switch honoured by ``init_mesh`` even against ``mesh=True``.

Examples::

    # Default: simulation (safe - no physical hardware interaction)
    sim = Robot("so100")

    # Explicit real hardware
    hw = Robot("so100", mode="real", cameras={...})

    # Auto-detect (probes USB for servo controllers)
    robot = Robot("so100", mode="auto")

    # With custom URDF/MJCF path
    sim = Robot("my_arm", urdf_path="/path/to/robot.xml")

GPU backends (resolved through ``create_simulation``; require the backend's
optional dependency or the ``strands-robots-sim`` plugin to be installed)::

    sim = Robot("unitree_go2", backend="isaac", num_envs=4096)
    sim = Robot("so100", backend="newton", num_envs=4096, device="cuda:0")

    This is a convenience factory, NOT a wrapper class.  You get the real
    backend instance back - with full access to all its methods.

    Defaults to simulation mode so that ``Robot("so100")`` never
    accidentally sends commands to physical hardware.  Use
    ``mode="real"`` to explicitly opt into hardware control.

    Args:
        name: Robot name ("so100", "aloha", "unitree_g1", "panda", ...)
              Accepts any alias defined in ``registry/robots.json``.
        mode: "sim" (default - safe), "real" (explicit hardware), or
              "auto" (probes USB for servo controllers, falls back to sim).
              Case-insensitive; surrounding whitespace ignored.
        backend: Simulation backend name or alias, resolved through
                 ``strands_robots.simulation.create_simulation`` - the same
                 registry that powers ``create_simulation()`` directly. Built-in:
                 ``"mujoco"`` (CPU, default; aliases ``"mj"``/``"mjc"``/``"mjx"``)
                 and ``"newton"`` (GPU, warp-lang based; alias ``"nt"``). Heavy
                 out-of-tree backends (``"isaac"``) ship in the ``strands-robots-sim``
                 plugin package and resolve once installed. An unavailable backend
                 surfaces the factory's actionable install hint. Backend-specific
                 kwargs (e.g. ``num_envs``, ``device``) are forwarded to the
                 backend constructor. Only applies to ``mode="sim"``; ignored for
                 ``mode="real"``.
        urdf_path: Explicit path to URDF/MJCF file. If not provided,
                   resolved via ``strands_robots.simulation.model_registry``
                   (asset manager or ``STRANDS_ASSETS_DIR`` search paths).
                   Only applies to ``mode="sim"``; in ``mode="real"`` it is
                   ignored and reported at debug level.
        cameras: Camera config for real hardware. Example::

            {"wrist": {"type": "opencv", "index_or_path": "/dev/video0", "fps": 30}}

            Note: In ``mode="sim"``, cameras must be added after creation
            via the simulation tool (``add_camera`` action). They cannot
            be passed to the factory yet.

        position: Robot base position in the sim world, ``[x, y, z]``. Passed
            through to the backend's ``add_robot`` verbatim, so the backend's
            contract governs: omitting it spawns at the origin, and a
            wrong-length, non-numeric or non-finite vector is refused with an
            actionable message (surfaced here as ``RuntimeError``) instead of
            being replaced by the origin. Only applies to ``mode="sim"``; in
            ``mode="real"`` it is ignored and reported at debug level.
        data_config: Data configuration name for observation/action schema.
                     For multi-camera setups, specify explicitly:
                     ``data_config="so100_dualcam"``. Honoured in both modes:
                     ``mode="sim"`` defaults it to the canonical robot name,
                     and ``mode="real"`` forwards it verbatim to
                     ``strands_robots.hardware_robot.Robot``, which carries it
                     into the ``policy_config`` a policy is built with.
        orientation: Robot base orientation in the sim world as a quaternion
            ``[w, x, y, z]``. Forwarded to the backend's ``add_robot`` verbatim
            on the same terms as ``position``: omitting it spawns unrotated, and
            a wrong-length, non-numeric or non-finite quaternion is refused with
            an actionable message (surfaced here as ``RuntimeError``) rather
            than being replaced by the identity rotation. Only applies to
            ``mode="sim"``; in ``mode="real"`` it is ignored and reported at
            debug level.
        keyframe: Spawn the robot in a canonical pose declared by a
            ``<keyframe>`` in its source model (e.g. panda ``"home"``, aloha
            ``"neutral_pose"``) instead of the default all-zero configuration.
            Accepts the keyframe name (``str``) or index (``int``) and is
            forwarded to the backend's ``add_robot`` verbatim, so that method's
            contract governs: the pose is sticky across ``reset()`` and an
            unknown keyframe is a hard error naming the available keyframes
            (surfaced here as ``RuntimeError``) instead of a silent zero-pose
            spawn. Only applies to ``mode="sim"``; in ``mode="real"`` it is
            ignored and reported at debug level.
        mesh: Attach a Zenoh fleet-coordination mesh. ``None`` (default) keeps
              mesh OFF for a quiet bare ``Robot(...)`` but honours the
              ``STRANDS_MESH=true`` opt-in. Pass ``True`` to force it on or
              ``False`` to force it off; an explicit value always wins over the
              env default. ``STRANDS_MESH=false`` is a hard kill switch.
        peer_id: Optional mesh peer identifier. Auto-generated when omitted.
        driver: Which implementation drives the robot in ``mode="real"``, one of
            :data:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.DRIVER_CHOICES`. ``"auto"``
            (default) states no preference: it honours the robot's registry
            ``hardware.driver`` and otherwise builds the lerobot driver, so a
            call that does not mention ``driver`` behaves exactly as before.
            ``"lerobot"`` pins that path explicitly. ``"strands"`` builds the
            native driver registered for this robot via
            :func:`~strands_robots.drivers.register_native_driver`, and is
            refused by name when none is - never quietly served the lerobot one.
            The value is checked in every mode, but only ``mode="real"`` acts on
            it; ``mode="sim"`` reports it as ignored at debug level.
        **kwargs: Forwarded to the underlying backend constructor.

    Returns:
        ``strands_robots.simulation.Simulation`` (sim) or
        ``strands_robots.hardware_robot.Robot`` (real hardware).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``mode`` is not 'sim'/'real'/'auto', if ``driver`` is not
                    one of :data:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.DRIVER_CHOICES`,

                    ``backend`` is not a known backend (the message lists the
                    available backends and any install hint).
        ImportError: If a known backend's optional dependency is missing
                     (e.g. ``newton`` without ``warp``); the message names the

    ``cleanup()`` is where a robot releases what it holds, and on hardware that

    which is where torque disable and gripper release live. Nothing else in the
    library reaches them - ``cleanup()`` is terminal, so no entry point runs
    after it, and lerobot's ``Robot.disconnect()`` refuses to be called by hand
    once the robot is half-open. So the teardown either happens here or it does
    not happen at all: the caller ends with ``os._exit``, which runs no
    ``atexit`` hook, no ``__del__`` and no ``finally`` block.

    The budget, and why the exit stays abrupt: ``Robot.cleanup()`` drains its
    task executor with ``shutdown(wait=True)``, which a wedged rollout does not
    finish - measured, a submitted item that never returns keeps that call
    running indefinitely, and a ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` worker is not a daemon
    thread, so the interpreter's own exit hook would then join it too. Awaiting
    the teardown on the calling thread, or returning normally and letting the
    interpreter tear down, therefore turns one operator Ctrl+C into a process
    that never exits - and an operator who reaches for ``SIGKILL`` gets no
    teardown at all, which is the outcome this exists to prevent. Running it on
