"""FastSAC - off-policy from-scratch RL trainer for the ``SimEngine`` env.

Soft Actor-Critic: an off-policy, sample-efficient peer of the on-policy
:class:`~strands_robots.training.rl.ppo.PpoTrainer`. It trains a tanh-squashed
Gaussian-MLP actor and twin Q critics (clipped double-Q, Polyak-averaged target
critics) with automatic entropy-temperature tuning, replaying transitions from a
:class:`~strands_robots.training.rl.replay_buffer.SimpleReplayBuffer`. Like PPO
it learns from a reward function alone (the reward-term DSL) on a
:class:`~strands_robots.training.rl.env.SimEnv`, so a reach / locomotion / WBC
policy can be trained in MuJoCo with no demonstration dataset.

Off-policy means the on-policy ``BaseRLAlgo.train()`` loop does not fit, so this
overrides :meth:`train` with the standard SAC schedule (random warmup -> per-step
gradient updates from the replay buffer) while keeping the same
``setup -> collect_rollout -> update -> save_checkpoint`` hooks and the
``policy.pt`` + ``policy_meta.json`` checkpoint contract as PPO. Selected via
``create_trainer("fast_sac")``.

The SAC math (clipped double-Q target, tanh-squashed log-prob correction,
automatic temperature) is the standard Haarnoja et al. formulation, adapted from
the Amazon FAR Holosoma FastSAC (BSD-3-Clause,
https://github.com/amazon-far/holosoma), re-homed onto the single-environment
MuJoCo backend.
