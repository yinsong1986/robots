"""FastTD3 - off-policy from-scratch RL trainer for the ``SimEngine`` env.

Twin Delayed DDPG: the deterministic-actor peer of
:class:`~strands_robots.training.rl.fast_sac.FastSacTrainer`. It trains a
tanh-bounded deterministic MLP actor against twin Q critics with clipped
double-Q targets, target policy smoothing (clipped Gaussian noise on the target
action), delayed actor / target-network updates (``policy_delay``), and Polyak
averaging, replaying transitions from a
:class:`~strands_robots.training.rl.replay_buffer.SimpleReplayBuffer`. Like SAC
it learns from a reward function alone (the reward-term DSL) on a
:class:`~strands_robots.training.rl.env.SimEnv`, so a reach / locomotion / WBC
policy can be trained in MuJoCo with no demonstration dataset.

Where SAC explores through its stochastic actor, a deterministic actor explores
only through the Gaussian ``exploration_noise_std`` added at collection - after
a uniform-random warmup of ``learning_starts`` steps - so that scale (and the
two smoothing scales) is preflighted rather than trusted: zero silently removes
the mechanism and the run still reports success.

Unlike the single-env FastSAC, collection is vectorized: ``num_envs > 1``
steps N independent envs through a
:class:`~strands_robots.training.rl.vec_env.VecSimEnv` and pushes N transitions
per tick, bootstrapping a done env's stored next-observation from the captured
pre-reset ``infos[i]["terminal_obs"]`` exactly as the vectorized PPO path
bootstraps its next-value - off-policy replay has no rollout tensor to reshape,
so the buffer absorbs the extra envs without changing the update.

Off-policy means the on-policy ``BaseRLAlgo.train()`` loop does not fit, so this
overrides :meth:`train` with the same schedule as FastSAC (random warmup ->
per-step gradient updates from the replay buffer) while keeping the same
``setup -> collect_rollout -> update -> save_checkpoint`` hooks and the
``policy.pt`` + ``policy_meta.json`` checkpoint contract as PPO / FastSAC.
Selected via ``create_trainer("fast_td3")``.

The TD3 math (clipped double-Q, target policy smoothing, delayed policy
updates) is the standard Fujimoto et al. formulation, benchmarked against the
FastTD3 project (https://github.com/younggyoseo/FastTD3, arXiv:2505.22642) and
re-homed onto the strands-robots ``SimEnv`` / ``VecSimEnv`` backend.
