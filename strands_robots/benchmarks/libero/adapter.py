"""``LiberoAdapter`` - :class:`BenchmarkProtocol` driven by a LIBERO BDDL file.

LIBERO is a suite of ~130 tabletop manipulation tasks built around a Franka
Panda. Each task ships as a BDDL problem file + an MJCF scene. The adapter
compiles the BDDL ``:goal`` into a sparse success predicate via
:mod:`strands_robots.benchmarks.libero.bddl_parser` and drives the scene
through the standard :class:`BenchmarkProtocol` lifecycle:

1. :meth:`on_episode_start` - optional ``sim.load_scene(scene_path)``, then
   the base ``BenchmarkProtocol`` compatibility check (Panda-only), then
   per-episode jitter of ``(:init ...)`` object positions.
2. :meth:`on_step` - sparse: ``StepInfo(reward=0.0, done=False)``. LIBERO
   does not define a dense reward.
3. :meth:`is_success` - walks the compiled ``:goal`` predicate tree against
   the current sim state.

**Panda-only by design.** LIBERO's scene MJCFs ``<include>`` Panda geometry
and BDDL predicates reference Panda gripper body names
(``robot0_gripper_*``). Retargeting to a different robot would require
rewriting every BDDL predicate against different body names and is out of
scope for this adapter. Subclass :class:`LiberoAdapter` and override
:attr:`supported_robots` + :attr:`default_robot` if you know what you're
doing.

The adapter does NOT require the ``libero`` Python package to be installed -
only a BDDL string / file and (optionally) an MJCF scene path. The
:func:`strands_robots.benchmarks.libero.suite.load_libero_suite` helper is
the one that pulls in the upstream package to discover task files.

        Args:
            problem: Parsed BDDL problem with a non-``None`` ``goal``.
            scene_path: Optional MJCF to ``sim.load_scene()`` on each
                episode start. ``None`` triggers ``auto_generate_scene``
                if enabled (see below).
            max_steps: Override the class-level 300.
            init_jitter: Per-episode ±jitter (metres) applied to xy of every
                object referenced by ``(:init (on A B))`` clauses. Default
                ``0.0`` matches LIBERO's deterministic-reset convention -
                the upstream training data is generated with fixed init
                states per ``(task, seed)`` and the GR00T-LIBERO checkpoint
                expects to see those exact poses (#166). Pass a positive
                value (e.g. ``0.02``) to layer per-episode randomization on
                top of the canonical state - useful for evaluating
                *generalization*, but expect lower nominal success rates
                because the policy is operating slightly out-of-distribution.
            install_cameras: When ``True`` (default), install the cameras
                in :attr:`LIBERO_CAMERAS` (or ``cameras`` override) on
                episode start. Set to ``False`` if your scene MJCF already
                declares the cameras the policy needs - the adapter will
                skip the install step entirely. Generated scenes have their
                cameras renamed to ``image`` / ``wrist_image`` (see
                ``scene_camera_aliases``), so the install step naturally
                no-ops on auto-generated scenes.
            cameras: Override / extend :attr:`LIBERO_CAMERAS`. Keyed by
                camera name, each value is forwarded as ``**kwargs`` to
                :meth:`Simulation.add_camera`. Passing an empty dict
                disables camera installation regardless of
                ``install_cameras``.
            eef_body_name: MuJoCo body name whose pose is read for the
                LIBERO ``state.x/y/z/roll/pitch/yaw`` keys *as a fallback*
                when ``eef_state_site_name`` is unset or doesn't resolve.
                ``None`` (default) triggers auto-resolution from the scene
                at episode start: when :meth:`_register_default_robot`
                discovers a scene-supplied Panda under
                ``scene_robot_prefix``, the adapter searches for the
                canonical RoboSuite EEF body (``<prefix>right_hand`` ->
                ``<prefix>hand`` -> bare ``hand``) and overrides
                ``_eef_body_name`` accordingly. Pass an explicit string
                to disable auto-resolution (useful for non-RoboSuite
                scenes); the legacy bare-Panda default is ``"hand"``.
            eef_state_site_name: MuJoCo *site* name whose pose is read
                for the LIBERO ``state.x/y/z/roll/pitch/yaw`` keys.
                ``None`` (default) auto-resolves to
                ``"<scene_gripper_prefix>grip_site"`` (i.e.
                ``"gripper0_grip_site"`` for LIBERO scenes), which
                matches what RoboSuite's ``OperationalSpaceController``
                reads for ``robot0_eef_pos`` / ``robot0_eef_quat`` —
                the site is at the gripper tip, ~9.7 cm BELOW the
                wrist body and rotated 180° around X to point fingers
                forward. Reading from the *body* (the round-5 default)
                feeds GR00T state observations from the wrong point in
                the kinematic chain, which manifested as ``success_rate
                = 0`` across rounds 23-30 of #168 because the policy
                saw out-of-distribution state and emitted near-zero
                deltas. The site is preferred; the body is used as a
                fallback when the site doesn't exist (non-RoboSuite
                scenes).
            gripper_joint_name: Joint name whose ``qpos`` is read for the
                LIBERO ``state.gripper`` key. ``None`` (default) triggers
                auto-resolution from the scene at episode start using
                the RoboSuite gripper-namespace convention: search for
                ``<scene_gripper_prefix>finger_joint1`` (e.g.
                ``gripper0_finger_joint1``) -> ``<scene_robot_prefix>finger_joint1``
                -> bare ``finger_joint1``. Pass an explicit string to
                disable auto-resolution; the legacy bare-Panda default
                is ``"finger_joint1"``. The Menagerie Panda's two-finger
                MJCF equality constraint mirrors the value to the second
                finger, so reading just one is sufficient.
            inject_eef_state: When ``True`` (default), the adapter's
                :meth:`augment_observation` injects ``x`` / ``y`` / ``z``
                / ``roll`` / ``pitch`` / ``yaw`` / ``gripper`` keys
                into the per-step observation so the ``libero_panda``
                ``Gr00tDataConfig`` finds them. Set to ``False`` when the
                sim already exposes those keys (e.g. via a custom
                ``observation_mapping`` on the policy or a backend that
                returns Cartesian state natively).
            auto_generate_scene: When ``True`` (default) AND ``scene_path``
                is ``None``, :meth:`on_episode_start` calls
                :meth:`_generate_scene_from_bddl` to build the scene MJCF
                via the upstream ``libero`` package's procedural
                generator. The generated XML is cached on disk so
                subsequent episodes / processes reuse it without
                re-running ``libero``. Set to ``False`` to keep the
                pre-#164 behaviour of running against a bare Panda when
                no ``scene_path`` is provided.
            scene_cache_dir: Filesystem location for the generated-scene
                cache. Defaults to ``$STRANDS_BASE_DIR/scene_cache/libero/``
                (typically ``~/.strands_robots/scene_cache/libero/``).
                Cache key is SHA256 of the BDDL source so two adapters
                built from the same BDDL share a cached XML.
            scene_camera_aliases: Mapping from MJCF camera name (as
                emitted by LIBERO / RoboSuite) to the policy-side
                observation key expected by the ``libero_panda``
                data_config. Default
                ``{"agentview": "image", "robot0_eye_in_hand": "wrist_image",
                "robot0_eye_in_hand_image": "wrist_image"}`` renames the
                two canonical RoboSuite cameras so
                ``Gr00tPolicy._build_service_observation`` finds them by
                bare-key lookup. Both ``robot0_eye_in_hand`` and the
                ``_image``-suffixed variant are mapped because RoboSuite's
                emitted MJCFs use the bare name on the ``<camera>`` element
                while older convention adds the ``_image`` suffix - this way
                the rename works regardless of upstream version. Pass an
                empty dict to disable renaming (the static fallbacks in
                :attr:`LIBERO_CAMERAS` will then fire because no scene
                camera matches the policy-side ``image`` / ``wrist_image``
                names; the wrist channel becomes a static top-down view
                which puts GR00T-LIBERO out-of-distribution every step).
                When this map is non-empty, its sorted contents are
                hashed into the scene-cache key so a regenerated cache
                automatically picks up alias changes (e.g. a user adding
                a new alias) instead of serving a stale rewrite.
            apply_scene_keyframe: When ``True`` (default) AND a scene was
                loaded, :meth:`on_episode_start` restores qpos/qvel to the
                scene's canonical home state AFTER ``super().on_episode_start``
                and any camera install. Two branches:

                * **Preferred** — when ``model.nkey > 0`` (MJCF declares a
                  ``<keyframe>``, which LIBERO-authored hand-written scenes
                  do): calls ``mujoco.mj_resetDataKeyframe(model, data,
                  scene_keyframe_index)``.
                * **Fallback** — when ``model.nkey == 0`` (MJCFs from the
                  procedural :meth:`_generate_scene_from_bddl` path don't
                  carry a keyframe): snapshot-and-restore. The first
                  episode after a scene compile captures
                  ``data.qpos.copy()`` / ``data.qvel.copy()``; every
                  subsequent episode does ``np.copyto(data.qpos,
                  snapshot.qpos)`` + ``mj_forward`` so derived state
                  reflects the canonical pose. This is the actual fix for
                  #166's ``success_rate=0.00`` symptom on the codepath
                  ``examples/libero_mujoco.py`` exercises.

                The two branches produce equivalent observable state, so
                tests that pin one work for the other; see
                ``TestApplyCanonicalState``. Set to ``False`` to disable
                both branches (useful for diagnostic comparisons against
                the pre-fix behaviour).
            scene_keyframe_index: Which ``<keyframe>`` to apply when
                the keyframe branch is taken (``model.nkey > 0``). Defaults
                to ``0`` (first keyframe), which is the LIBERO convention.
                Pass a different index to select a non-default home pose.
                Ignored when the snapshot fallback fires.
            scene_robot_prefix: Body / joint / actuator name prefix that
                identifies the scene-supplied Panda when the adapter
                pre-registers it in ``world.robots`` (#166 round-4
                fix). Default ``"robot0_"`` matches RoboSuite / LIBERO's
                canonical naming for the upstream MJCFs (both
                hand-authored and procedurally-generated). Set to ``""``
                or change to a different prefix when working with a
                custom scene that names its Panda differently. The
                pre-register step no-ops silently when no body matches
                the prefix - super() then falls back to its standard
                ``add_robot`` path.
            scene_gripper_prefix: Body / joint name prefix that
                identifies the scene-supplied gripper. Default
                ``"gripper0_"`` matches RoboSuite's gripper namespace
                (separate from ``scene_robot_prefix`` because RoboSuite
                attaches grippers via its own naming scheme). Used by
                the gripper-joint auto-resolver in
                :meth:`_register_default_robot` when
                ``gripper_joint_name=None`` (default). Ignored when an
                explicit ``gripper_joint_name`` is supplied.
            init_states: Optional ``ndarray[(N, 1+nq+nv)]`` of LIBERO's
                canonical training-distribution init states for this
                task. ``None`` (default) falls through to the keyframe
                / snapshot-restore branches in
                :meth:`_apply_canonical_state`. When supplied,
                :meth:`_apply_init_state` picks one row per episode
                (RNG-seeded so a given seed re-runs the same init
                across re-evaluations) and writes
                ``data.time / data.qpos / data.qvel`` directly. The
                width of each row MUST equal ``1 + model.nq +
                model.nv`` - mismatches indicate the procedurally-
                generated MJCF diverges from upstream LIBERO's scene
                MJCF (e.g. missing ``(:objects ...)`` declarations) and
                are raised loudly rather than silently sliced. The
                array is cached as a member; populate via
                :func:`load_libero_suite` (which lazy-imports
                ``libero.libero.benchmark`` and calls
                ``ts.get_task_init_states(task_id)``) or pass
                explicitly. Without this kwarg the robot starts at

        canonical state, validate Panda, install cameras, then apply jitter.

        Order matters:

        1. **Scene resolution.** When ``scene_path`` is ``None`` and
           ``auto_generate_scene`` is true, build the scene MJCF from the
           BDDL via the upstream ``libero`` package's procedural generator
           and cache it on disk. Subsequent episodes / processes reuse the
           cached XML without re-running ``libero``.
        2. ``load_scene`` (if a path is now set) - so the base
           compatibility check sees the scene's Panda rather than reporting
           "sim is empty → load default_robot".
        3. **Canonical-state apply.** ``mj_makeData`` (in
           :meth:`Simulation.load_scene`) and ``mj_resetData`` (in
           :meth:`Simulation.reset`) both initialise qpos from the
           joint-default ``qpos0`` and **silently ignore MJCF
           ``<keyframe>`` blocks**. RoboSuite-emitted LIBERO scenes encode
           the canonical home pose in a ``<keyframe>`` (rare); the
           procedurally-generated MJCFs from #165 don't ship one
           (``model.nkey == 0``), so :meth:`_apply_canonical_state` falls
           back to snapshot-and-restore - capture qpos/qvel on the first
           episode, replay on subsequent ones. **Applied IMMEDIATELY after
           ``load_scene``** (before super / install_cameras) so the
           snapshot captures the post-load canonical state without any
           recompile-induced qpos drift; super() and install_cameras
           below then operate on top of canonical state.
        4. ``super().on_episode_start`` - base compat check + auto-load
           ``default_robot`` if the sim is empty. (Note: this *can*
           recompile the spec via ``add_robot``; MuJoCo's ``spec.recompile``
           preserves qpos for existing joints, so the canonical state we
           just restored survives.)
        5. ``_install_libero_cameras`` - inject the cameras the
           ``libero_panda`` ``Gr00tDataConfig`` expects (``image`` /
           ``wrist_image``). Detects scene-supplied cameras via the
           compiled model so the static-pose fallbacks only fire when the
           scene genuinely didn't provide them - this matters for not
           recompiling the spec on top of our just-restored canonical
           state (#166 review finding).
        6. ``_install_render_options`` - populate
           ``sim._world._backend_state["viz_option"]`` with an
           ``mjvOption`` matching upstream LIBERO's
           ``OffScreenRenderEnv`` viewer config (#168 round 9 bug E).
           The render path in ``simulation/mujoco/rendering.py`` reads
           that option and threads it to ``Renderer.update_scene(..., scene_option=...)``,
           hiding collision geoms / site markers / joint /
           actuator / COM widgets. Skipped on bare-Panda fallback
           (no scene loaded - default render options are appropriate
           for the user's own MJCF).
        7. ``_apply_init_jitter`` - per-episode RNG-seeded ±jitter to
           init-subject bodies, layered on top of canonical state.

        Round 43 (#168) — :class:`LiberoOffScreenRenderEngine`
        fast-path. When the engine implements
        :meth:`setup_libero_task` (duck-typed check), the entire
        scene-generation + canonical-state-apply + camera-install +
        action-controller-install pipeline above is bypassed in favour
        of upstream ``OffScreenRenderEnv`` semantics. The engine does
        all that work itself via robosuite. We just hand it the BDDL
        path and (optional) init_state and let it run. This is the
        path that matches NVIDIA's reference eval (``success_rate=1.0``
        in 54s for 5 eps on libero_10/SCENE5) byte-for-byte.

        Why this exists (#168 round-10 / bug D'): the recorder thread
        spawned by :meth:`Simulation.start_cameras_recording` captures
        its first frame *immediately*, before
        :meth:`evaluate_benchmark` (and therefore
        :meth:`on_episode_start`) runs. Without ``viz_option`` already
        in ``world._backend_state``, that first frame renders with
        MuJoCo's default visualization options - collision capsules,
        site markers (``gripper0_ft_frame`` red dot,
        ``gripper0_grip_site_cylinder`` green line), joint axes, and
        actuator widgets all visible. Subsequent frames are clean
        because :meth:`_install_render_options` runs as part of
        ``on_episode_start``.

        Round-13 verification (#168) revealed a second, more severe
        race: the renderer returns a skybox-only gradient for any
        ``render(camera=...)`` call when ``data.xpos`` / ``data.xmat``
        haven't been populated yet. ``mujoco.MjData`` allocates these
        arrays at construction (e.g. inside ``Simulation.load_scene``)
        but doesn't compute them - they stay at zero / identity until
        ``mj_forward(model, data)`` runs. Until then,
        ``Renderer.update_scene`` finds the body transforms unset and
        falls back to the skybox-only readback (the gradient artifact).

        Concrete recorder timeline pre-fix:

        ::

            T0:  sim.load_scene(...)        # MjData allocated, NOT forwarded
            T0+: spec.prewarm(sim)          # registers robot + cameras + viz_option
            T1:  sim.start_cameras_recording  # recorder thread launches capture loop
            T1+: evaluate_benchmark starts
                 on_episode_start runs:
                   - load_scene (fresh MjData)
                   - _apply_canonical_state  # ← finally calls mj_forward here

            Meanwhile the recorder thread:
              capture iter 1: render(image)   # before main-thread mj_forward → gradient
              capture iter 1: render(wrist)   # may land after mj_forward → real
                                              #   (depending on race timing)

        The first capture frame for whichever camera renders before
        ``mj_forward`` returns gradient. Round 13's 2-pass warmup
        loop in ``_loop`` didn't help because warmup-of-any-depth
        on any thread can't conjure populated body transforms - only
        ``mj_forward`` does that.

        Round 14 fix: prewarm calls ``mj_forward`` itself. After
        prewarm, ``data.xpos`` / ``data.xmat`` are populated and the
        recorder's first render returns real geometry regardless of
        thread or camera order.

        This method exposes the *idempotent subset* of
        :meth:`on_episode_start` setup that should run before recording
        starts. Each call is no-op-on-prior-state safe:

        * :meth:`_register_default_robot` - early-returns if
          ``"robot"`` is already in ``world.robots``.
        * :meth:`_install_libero_cameras` - skips cameras already
          present in the model or registry.
        * :meth:`_install_render_options` - overwrites
          ``world._backend_state["viz_option"]`` with a freshly-built
          ``MjvOption``; semantically equivalent on every call.
        * ``mujoco.mj_forward(model, data)`` - populates derived
          state from ``qpos`` / ``qvel``. Safe to call multiple times;
          re-runs the same forward dynamics computation each call.

        Calling :meth:`prewarm` does NOT replace
        :meth:`on_episode_start` - the latter still runs the full
        per-episode lifecycle (canonical-state apply, init jitter,
        super-class compatibility check, etc.). Prewarm is just an
        early-rendering hint.

        Recommended call site (e.g. ``examples/libero_mujoco.py``)::

            sim.load_scene(spec.scene_path)        # scene-supplied Panda is in the loaded MJCF
            spec.prewarm(sim)                      # registers wrapper + viz_option + init_state[0] + mj_forward
            sim.start_cameras_recording(...)       # recorder's first frame is the canonical ready pose
            result = sim.evaluate_benchmark(...)

        IMPORTANT: do NOT call ``sim.add_robot("robot", data_config="panda")``
        between ``load_scene`` and ``prewarm`` for LIBERO scenes. The
        scene MJCF already contains the Panda; ``add_robot`` would weld
        a redundant Panda into the spec via spec recompile, bumping
        ``model.nq`` past what ``init_states[0]`` was sized for, and
        prewarm's init-state apply would silently no-op (logged at
        WARNING). This is bug-D-residual #168 round 18; the
        ``_register_default_robot`` step inside prewarm wraps the
        scene-supplied Panda automatically without needing a separate
        ``add_robot`` call.

        Assumes ``sim`` already has the scene loaded (via
        ``sim.load_scene``). Adapters built from a BDDL without a
        scene will see ``self.scene_path is None``; in that case
        prewarm is a no-op since there's nothing to install
        render-options against.

        Best-effort: any individual step's failure is caught and
        logged at WARNING - never aborts the whole prewarm because a
        failure here would just degrade rendering, not crash eval
        (the per-episode :meth:`on_episode_start` will retry).

        **Round 31 fix (#168 — pose source).** Read EEF pose from the
        gripper *site* (``self.eef_state_site_name`` →
        ``"gripper0_grip_site"`` for LIBERO scenes) instead of the
        wrist *body* (``self._eef_body_name`` → ``"robot0_right_hand"``).
        These differ by ~9.7 cm in z and 180° rotation around X — the
        site is at the gripper TIP, the body is at the wrist. RoboSuite's
        ``OperationalSpaceController`` reads from the site for its own
        ``robot0_eef_pos`` / ``robot0_eef_quat`` observables, so reading
        from the same site here produces state observations matching
        what LIBERO checkpoints were trained against. Reading from the
        body fed GR00T out-of-distribution state, which manifested as
        ``success_rate = 0`` across rounds 23-30.

        Implementation:

        1. Try the SITE path first via direct
           ``mujoco.mj_name2id(model, mjtObj.mjOBJ_SITE, eef_state_site_name)``,
           reading ``data.site_xpos`` + ``data.site_xmat``.
        2. Fall back to the BODY path via
           ``sim.get_body_state(self._eef_body_name)`` for non-RoboSuite
           scenes that don't ship the canonical site (e.g. bare
           Menagerie Panda). The fallback path matches the pre-round-31
           behaviour exactly.
        3. Convert the site/body's rotation matrix or quaternion to
           extrinsic XYZ Euler ``(roll, pitch, yaw)`` to match the
           LIBERO/RoboSuite ``mat2euler(..., axes='sxyz')`` convention
           the dataset and policy were trained on.
        4. Read gripper opening from ``obs[self._gripper_joint_name]``
           (already populated by ``Simulation.get_observation``).

        Best-effort: if any source is missing (sim doesn't expose
        ``get_body_state``, site absent and body absent, gripper joint
        absent), the corresponding key is omitted with a debug log. The
        original observation is returned with the resolved keys merged
        in - we never delete or overwrite an obs key the sim already
        provided (so a backend that natively returns Cartesian state
        wins).

        Disable this entirely with ``inject_eef_state=False`` on the

        # Round 39 (#168) — flip rendered images vertically to match
        # upstream LIBERO's ``OffScreenRenderEnv`` pixel convention.
        #
        # WHY: our ``sim.render()`` returns top-row-zero (image
        # convention), but upstream LIBERO's ``OffScreenRenderEnv``
        # returns bottom-row-zero (OpenGL framebuffer convention). The
        # GR00T-N1.7-LIBERO checkpoint was trained against upstream's
        # convention with an additional ``[::-1, ::-1]`` rotation
        # applied at training time by ``LiberoEnv._process_observation``
        # (mirrored in the inference path via the policy's
        # ``image_rotation_180`` flag).
        #
        # Round-39 ``tests_integ/.../diff_libero_obs.py`` measured the
        # delta: ``mean |Δ| = 56/255`` for raw vs raw, but
        # ``mean |Δ| = 5.40/255`` after applying ``[::-1, :]`` to ours
        # — a 10× reduction confirming the vertical-flip-only
        # mismatch (a horizontal mirror would have shown the opposite
        # asymmetry).
        #
        # WHAT: flip our renders vertically so they're in upstream
        # OffScreenRenderEnv convention. The policy's existing
        # ``image_rotation_180`` flag (which applies ``[::-1, ::-1]``)
        # then converts upstream-convention to training-image
        # convention as designed.
        #
        # Applied to BOTH ``image`` and ``wrist_image`` because both
        # come from our mujoco renderer with the same convention. We
        # use ``np.ascontiguousarray`` so downstream serialization
        # (msgpack / numpy.tobytes()) works — reversed views are not
        # contiguous.

        The site sits at the gripper tip; the body sits at the wrist
        (~9.7 cm above the site). Their rotation matrices have a 90°
        offset around Z relative to each other — RoboSuite picks the
        body's orientation deliberately because that's what the
        downstream observable + dataset expects.

        Round 30 (#168) found we read both pos AND quat from the
        wrist body — pos was 71.8 mm off in z and orientation 180°
        off in roll. Round 31 moved BOTH to the site, which fixed
        position (within 5 mm) but introduced a 90° yaw offset
        because site_xmat ≠ body xquat. Round 32 splits the reads
        the way RoboSuite does.

        identified via ``hasattr(sim, '_env')`` + the env's
        ``check_success`` method), delegate to robosuite's native
        success check rather than walking our BDDL predicate tree.

        WHY: round-44 instrumentation found that our
        :func:`compile_goal`-produced predicate tree disagrees with
        the env's ``check_success`` for ``libero-10/SCENE5``: the
        policy was actually solving the task (verified via
        ``env.check_success() == True``) but our BDDL evaluator was
        returning ``False``, so the rollout loop kept running until
        ``max_steps`` truncation and the run ended with

        ``OffScreenRenderEnv`` (e.g. our ``MuJoCoSimEngine``); the
        residual bug in the BDDL predicate evaluator is a separate
        investigation track.

        Best-effort: if any introspection step fails (the env
        doesn't have ``check_success``, or ``check_success`` raises),

        4. Apply :attr:`_scene_camera_aliases` via a targeted XML
           rename so the policy-side cameras (``image`` / ``wrist_image``)
           resolve to the LIBERO-canonical viewpoints.

        Goal: make ``sim.list_robots()`` return non-empty BEFORE

        :class:`BenchmarkProtocol` skips its unconditional

        jumps ``44 → 53`` on LIBERO SCENE5) and leaves the redundant
        Panda's plastic shells right in front of the ``image`` camera
        — that's #166 round-4's smoking gun: every "real-render" frame
        is yellow-saturated by the second Panda's links 5/6.

        The fix has to register a wrapper for the **existing** Panda
        without recompiling. Two-step detection:

        1. Walk the compiled MuJoCo model's body names looking for the
           robosuite/LIBERO ``robot0_`` prefix (the standard naming
           convention for the hand-authored and procedurally-generated
           LIBERO scenes alike).
        2. If found, build a :class:`SimRobot` whose ``namespace`` matches
           the discovered prefix and whose ``joint_names`` /
           ``actuator_ids`` come from filtering the model's joint /
           actuator pools by the same prefix. Register it directly in
           ``world.robots`` under the canonical key ``"robot"`` so
           super() finds it.

        Best-effort:

        * Sim without a compiled MuJoCo model → debug-log + skip.
          super() will fall through to its own add_robot path; that
          path is the bug we're trying to avoid, but on a non-MuJoCo
          backend it's the only correct behaviour anyway.
        * No body matches the ``robot0_`` prefix → debug-log + skip.
          The scene didn't supply a Panda; super() should add one.
        * Robot already registered under ``"robot"`` (defensive) →
          no-op.

        * Site markers (``sitegroup[*] = 0`` for all 6 groups). Includes
          ``gripper0_ft_frame`` (red dot - force-torque frame),
          ``gripper0_grip_site`` (semi-transparent red sphere),
          ``gripper0_grip_site_cylinder`` (green line - grasp-axis
          cylinder). Default ``sitegroup`` shows them; reviewer caught
          them as "red dot + green line in the middle of agentview".
        * Joint visualisations (``mjVIS_JOINT = 0``). Hides the
          axis-arrow widgets MuJoCo draws on each ``<joint>`` definition.
        * Actuator visualisations (``mjVIS_ACTUATOR = 0``). Hides the
          actuator-pose markers.
        * COM markers (``mjVIS_COM = 0``). Hides the per-body
          centre-of-mass widgets.

        These match exactly what ``OffScreenRenderEnv`` configures
        internally - verified empirically against ``upstream-agentview.png``,
        which renders within Δ=2.4 RGB units of upstream when the same
        flags are applied to our cache.

        Round 8 used to do equivalent work via MJCF post-process
        (``_apply_libero_visual_fixes`` set rgba alpha=0 on collision
        geoms and stacked a ``<headlight>`` block in ``<visual>``).
        That worked for the agentview mean-RGB metric but the
        ``<headlight>`` *doubled* the lighting (upstream already has
        two ``<light>`` blocks in the worldbody) and washed out the
        contrast that makes the white mug pop. Round 9 reverts the
        MJCF rewrites entirely (cache now matches
        ``OffScreenRenderEnv.sim.model.get_xml()`` verbatim except for
        the camera-name aliases) and instead lets the render-time
        options handle visibility - the architecturally correct place.

        Best-effort: ``mujoco`` not importable -> debug-log + skip.
        ``world`` missing or ``_backend_state`` not a dict -> skip.
        Default :class:`MuJoCoSimulation` always exposes
        ``_world._backend_state``, so the skip cases are defensive

        torque-mode joint actuators (``robot0_torq_j1..7`` plus 2

        up GR00T's action keys by name in the model's actuator/joint
        tables, finds no match, and silently drops every action - the
        policy effectively sends zero torque (#168 round 23 verification).

        This installs a :class:`_LiberoOSCController` instance in

        """Restore qpos / qvel to the scene's canonical home state.

        Three branches, in order of preference:

        1. **Init states** (``self._init_states is not None``): pick a row
           via ``rng`` (RNG-seeded so a given seed re-runs the same init
           across re-evaluations, fall back to ``random.Random()`` when
           no rng is provided), validate the width matches
           ``1 + model.nq + model.nv``, then write
           ``data.time / data.qpos / data.qvel`` directly. This is the
           branch that landed in #168 round 7 to fix bug I (success_rate=0
           because the robot started at qpos=0 instead of LIBERO's
           canonical "ready" pose). Width mismatches are raised loudly
           rather than silently sliced - they indicate the procedurally-
           generated MJCF diverges from upstream LIBERO's scene MJCF
           (e.g. missing ``(:objects ...)`` declarations).
        2. **Keyframe** (``model.nkey > 0``): call
           ``mujoco.mj_resetDataKeyframe(model, data, scene_keyframe_index)``.
           The MJCF carries the canonical pose explicitly via a
           ``<keyframe>`` element - LIBERO-authored hand-written scenes
           (the ones in upstream ``libero/libero/assets/scenes/``) ship one.
        3. **Snapshot-and-restore** (``model.nkey == 0``): cache
           ``data.qpos`` / ``data.qvel`` on the FIRST episode after a
           scene compile (after ``super().on_episode_start`` and
           ``_install_libero_cameras`` have run); restore the cached
           snapshot on every subsequent episode. The procedurally-
           generated MJCFs from :meth:`_generate_scene_from_bddl` (PR #165)
           don't carry a keyframe, so this branch fires when init_states
           is also None (e.g. adapters built directly from a BDDL file
           without going through :func:`load_libero_suite`).

        All three branches end with ``mj_forward`` so derived state
        (``xpos`` / ``xquat`` / sensor data) reflects the canonical
        ``qpos`` before the next ``get_observation`` / ``render`` call.

        Best-effort:

        * Sims without an exposed compiled MuJoCo model -> debug-log + skip.
        * ``scene_keyframe_index`` out of range when ``nkey > 0`` -> log
          at WARNING and skip (out-of-range is a config error).
        * ``mujoco`` not importable -> debug-log + skip.
        * Snapshot shape mismatches the current ``qpos`` (e.g. the
          model recompiled with a different ``nq`` between episodes,
          which is unusual) -> re-capture instead of restoring.

        Holds ``sim._lock`` if the sim exposes one to match the locking
        contract of :meth:`Simulation.reset` and :meth:`Simulation.send_action`
        - prevents racing a worker holding a stale qpos pointer.

        :func:`mujoco.mj_forward` to update derived state.

        Layout per
        ``/opt/conda/lib/python3.12/site-packages/robosuite/utils/binding_utils.py:213-241``
        (``MjSimState.from_flattened``): ``[time(1), qpos(nq), qvel(nv)]``,
        with ``na == 0`` asserted (no actuator state). LIBERO's
        ``OffScreenRenderEnv.set_init_state`` calls
        ``sim.set_state_from_flattened(state)`` which decomposes the
        same way, so applying directly to MuJoCo's ``data`` here matches
        the reference v0.1.1 LIBERO eval pipeline.

        Width mismatch is fatal (raises ``RuntimeError``) - the
        procedurally-generated MJCF must match upstream LIBERO's scene
        for init-state apply to make any sense. Silent slicing /
        padding would produce a deeply wrong physical state and mask
        a real scene-generation bug. Per AGENTS.md "no silent defaults
        on error".

        Episode 0 is pinned to ``init_states[0]`` deterministically;
        episodes 1+ are RNG-sampled. This matches v0.1.1 ``env_libero.py``'s
        ``env.set_init_state(init_states[0])`` pattern for the first
        episode and aligns with :meth:`prewarm`'s init-state apply
        (which also uses idx 0). The recorder's t=0.00 frame and the
        policy's first observation are then visually identical -
        critical for the visual-acceptance regression suite where
        users compare "first recorded frame" against "expected
        starting pose" (#168 round 16 bug D-residual).

        Per-episode RNG-seeded selection (episodes 1+): ``rng.randint(0, n_states-1)``.
        Re-running the same seed produces the same init state for the
        same episode index. ``rng=None`` falls back to a fresh
        ``random.Random()`` so direct calls (e.g. unit tests) still
        work.

    """Construct a :class:`SimRobot` for an existing scene-supplied Panda.

    Walks the compiled MuJoCo ``model`` looking for bodies / joints /
    actuators whose names start with ``prefix`` (default ``"robot0_"``,
    matching RoboSuite / LIBERO's canonical naming for the arm). When
    ``gripper_prefix`` is non-empty, joints AND actuators starting with
    *either* prefix are included in the wrapper - this is critical for
    RoboSuite-emitted scenes because the gripper has its own namespace
    (``gripper0_``) separate from the arm's (``robot0_``). Without the
    gripper prefix, ``gripper0_finger_joint{1,2}`` and the gripper
    actuator would be silently dropped from ``wrapper.joint_names`` and
    ``wrapper.actuator_ids``, the upstream observation pipeline would
    omit them from ``obs``, and downstream code looking up
    ``obs.get("gripper0_finger_joint1")`` (e.g.
    :meth:`LiberoAdapter.augment_observation` after
    :meth:`_resolve_scene_eef_and_gripper` resolves the gripper joint)
    would silently get ``None``. That manifests as
    ``state.gripper`` being omitted from the GR00T request and the
    server rejecting with ``State key 'state.gripper' must be in
    observation`` (#168 round-5 bug G).

    Body discovery uses ``prefix`` only - in RoboSuite/LIBERO MJCFs the
    gripper is mounted as a child body of the arm's last link, not a
    root-level body, so its bodies don't need to be in the joint-pool
    filter. We just need the joints / actuators that move it.

    Returns a :class:`SimRobot` whose IDs and namespace are filled in
    from the discovered names, or ``None`` when no body matches the arm
    prefix.

    The returned wrapper is only useful for **populating
    ``world.robots``** so ``BenchmarkProtocol.on_episode_start``'s
    ``list_robots()`` check returns non-empty. It is NOT a substitute
    for the wrapper that ``Simulation.add_robot`` builds via
    ``inject_robot_into_scene`` - that call also recompiles the spec
    and registers tendon / actuator side-effects we don't want here.
    The whole point of this discovery path is to avoid that recompile.

    Body / joint / actuator IDs are read from the *current* compiled
    model. If the spec is recompiled later (e.g. by
    ``_install_libero_cameras``), the IDs may no longer be valid; the
    adapter relies on its model-side camera detection (#167 / #166
    follow-up) to keep that recompile from firing.

    Returns ``None`` when:

    * No body name starts with ``prefix``.
    * ``model`` doesn't expose ``nbody`` / ``njnt`` / ``nu`` (e.g. a
      stub injected by tests).

    Discovery never raises - any unexpected MuJoCo error is caught at

        The OSC controller computes inverse Jacobian using

        :meth:`LiberoAdapter._forward_mj_data` must have run before
        this is first called (otherwise xpos/xmat are uninitialized).
        Round-15's ``mj_forward`` in ``Simulation.load_scene``
        guarantees this.

        **Round-27 control-rate fix.** LIBERO trains at 20 Hz control
        with 500 Hz physics → 25 physics substeps per policy action.
        We mirror RoboSuite's standard step loop

                mj_step(model, data)

        Each ``run_controller`` re-reads xpos/xmat/qpos/qvel/Jacobian
        via ``controller.update()`` (gated by the ``new_update`` flag
        which is set every iteration by the base class), so the OSC
        torques track the integrated state. Without the substep loop
        we ran OSC at 500 Hz (the physics rate) — the controller
        designed each torque profile for a 25-step horizon but only
        applied it for 1 step before the policy delivered a fresh
        delta, leading to the round-26 "robot moves but never
        converges" symptom.

        ``owns_stepping = True`` tells the SimEngine not to call
        ``mj_step`` again after this returns; we've already advanced
        physics by the full control timestep.
