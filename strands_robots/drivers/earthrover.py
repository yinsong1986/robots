"""EarthRover Mini Plus native driver.

The Earth Rover (FrodoBots) is a mobile outdoor base reached over HTTP: the
vendor's `earth-rovers-sdk <https://github.com/frodobots-org/earth-rovers-sdk>`_
runs on the host (default ``http://localhost:8001``), proxies commands to the
rover over WebRTC/RTM, and exposes four endpoints this driver speaks:

* ``POST /control`` - one twist frame, ``{"command": {"linear", "angular",
  "lamp"}}``, each axis normalised to ``[-1, 1]``.
* ``GET /data`` - the telemetry snapshot: battery, GPS, orientation, IMU,
  wheel RPMs, signal level, lamp state.
* ``GET /v2/front`` / ``GET /v2/rear`` - one camera frame, base64 in the
  ``{camera}_frame`` field.
* ``POST /speak`` - text out of the rover's speaker.

The whole of that is the *agent's* surface too: :attr:`EarthRoverDriver.tool_spec`
declares one verb per capability (``sensors``, ``status``, ``camera``, ``move``,
``lamp``, ``speak``, ``stop``) and :meth:`EarthRoverDriver.stream` dispatches
each to the method that owns its judgement. A ``Robot("earthrover",
mode="real", driver="strands")`` handle therefore goes straight into
``Agent(tools=[rover])`` and the model can drive the rover it can see.

``requests`` is the transport, declared by the ``[earthrover]`` extra
(``pip install 'strands-robots[earthrover]'``, a member of ``[all]``). It is
imported lazily so the module loads and registers without it; a real connection
needs it and a running SDK, and :meth:`EarthRoverDriver.connect_eagerly` reports
the absent extra rather than raising.

Safety note: a rover is VELOCITY-commanded - unlike an arm, it does not hold
still when you stop talking to it, and whether the firmware times a twist out
on its own is not documented by the vendor. Until that answer exists,
:meth:`EarthRoverDriver.cleanup` sends a best-effort zero twist before closing
the session, so a clean teardown is always a STOP - the same reasoning as
feetech's torque-off loop, and errors are swallowed for the same reason: a
dead link must not block the close, and a rover behind a dead link cannot
hear a stop anyway.

Turn-direction note: the SDK/hardware already matches the ``+angular = left``
convention, so no inversion is applied by default. A rover observed turning
the wrong way is corrected with ``turn_sign=-1`` at construction rather than
an environment variable, so the correction is visible at the call site that
needed it.

    Refuses rather than clamping, which is the disposition the module docstring's
    safety note argues for: a rover is **velocity**-commanded, so a twist it was
    never asked for keeps being executed until the next command arrives. Clamping
    maps every out-of-range magnitude onto full speed, so the most common way to

    fastest motion the base has, indefinitely, and reports success. A caller on a

    """Report why ``value`` is not an SDK base URL, or ``None`` if it is one.

    ``port=`` is polymorphic across drivers - a serial path on the arms, an IP
    on the DDS robots, a URL here - so the wrong *shape* is refused at the
    chokepoint with a sentence naming the shape that belongs elsewhere, not by
    ``requests`` failing with "No host supplied" one call later.

    Beyond the shape, the base URL has to address *the host the caller wrote*.
    Every endpoint below is built from it, so a value whose authority names one
    host and dials another sends ``POST /control`` - a drive command - to a
    rover the caller never named, and ``connect_eagerly`` reports success when
    anything answers there. Two spellings do that, and neither is refused by
    the transport, which reports only the host it ended up with:

    * **Userinfo.** Everything before an ``@`` in the authority is credentials,
      so ``bot.local@10.0.0.9:8001`` dials ``10.0.0.9`` while the address still
      reads as ``bot.local`` - including in ``get_status``, which reports the
      base URL back verbatim.
    * **A foreign scheme.** ``ws://10.0.0.9:8001`` has no ``http`` prefix to
      recognise, so it is prefixed into ``http://ws://10.0.0.9:8001``, whose
      authority is ``ws:``. The request goes to the host ``ws`` on port 80 and
      the port the caller wrote is discarded - the same way the host half of a
      dialled address discards a validated port in
      :func:`~strands_robots.utils.dial_host_error`.

    That shared domain is deliberately *not* used here. It grades a bare host
    destined for interpolation into ``ws://{host}:{port}``, where an IPv6
    literal needs its brackets; the host inside a base URL has already been
    parsed, so ``http://[::1]:8001`` presents as ``::1`` and would be refused
    as "not a bare hostname or IP" - a legitimate base URL rejected.

    Everything else unusable here is left to the transport, which already names
    it: ``http:`` and ``//host`` raise ``InvalidURL: No host supplied``, and an
    out-of-range port or an embedded space raises ``InvalidURL: Failed to
    parse``. Both are ``ValueError`` subclasses, so ``connect_eagerly`` converts
    them into its own reason.

        value: The candidate base URL.
        param: Parameter name to quote in the reason.
        context: Calling surface to quote in the reason.

    passing a format flag.

    Coordinates go through :func:`~strands_robots.drivers.base.telemetry_float`
    rather than straight into the format string, because an agent verb must not
    raise past its dispatcher: a latitude the SDK reported as a string formats
    with ``ValueError`` under ``:.6f``, which would lose the battery and signal
