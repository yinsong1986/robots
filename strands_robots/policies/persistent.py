"""Persistent, reusable policy handles - load the model once, reuse everywhere.

Loading a VLA / LeRobot checkpoint (a MolmoAct2 SO-100/101 build reads ~1300
weight files into GPU memory) costs on the order of a minute or two. A naive
multi-episode loop that calls :func:`create_policy` per rollout pays that cost
every episode; the dominant fix already exists - a process-level model cache in
:mod:`strands_robots.policies.lerobot_local.policy` shares the resident weights
across instances - but two ergonomic gaps remained:

1. The win was implicit. There was no first-class "load this once and hand me a
   handle I reuse" object, so an LLM harness driving the API blind had no
   obvious way to express the intent and would re-call ``create_policy``.
2. There was no provider-agnostic way to *warm* the cache ahead of a run, *see*
   what is resident, or *free* a checkpoint between runs of different policies.

This module closes both. :class:`PersistentPolicy` is a thin, thread-safe
wrapper that builds the underlying policy ONCE at construction and is meant to
be passed to every ``run_policy``/``eval_policy`` call via ``policy_object=``::

    from strands_robots.policies import PersistentPolicy

    policy = PersistentPolicy("lerobot_local", pretrained_name_or_path="...")
    for _ in range(20):
        sim.run_policy(robot_name="arm", policy_object=policy)  # zero reload
        sim.save_episode()
        sim.reset()

The :func:`preload`, :func:`list_cached`, and :func:`evict` helpers are the
agent-facing cache controls: warm before a run, introspect what is hot, free
memory before switching checkpoints.

This is a SYNCHRONOUS persistent worker: the model lives in-process and is
shared via the module-level cache. It deliberately does not spawn a background
daemon or expose cross-process IPC - inference is GIL- and GPU-serialised, so a
per-call lock gives correct concurrent reuse without the complexity (and races)
of a separate worker process. Cross-process sharing is a separable concern.

class _LockHandoff:
    """Cancellation-safe handoff of a :class:`threading.Lock` to a coroutine.

    ``threading.Lock.acquire`` blocks uninterruptibly, so a coroutine that
    acquires it via ``loop.run_in_executor`` cannot cancel the acquire once the
    executor thread has entered it: cancelling the future raises
    ``CancelledError`` in the awaiting task while the executor thread goes on to
    take the lock, and nothing is left to release it. On a handle shared across
    every ``run_policy``/``eval_policy`` call that permanently freezes all
    subsequent inference.

    This object closes that window by making the acquire hand the lock over
    under a tiny guard mutex:

    * :meth:`acquire` (executor thread) takes the lock, then publishes it to the
      waiting coroutine - unless the coroutine already abandoned the acquire, in
      which case it releases the lock immediately.
    * :meth:`abandon` (loop thread, in the cancellation handler) marks the
      acquire abandoned and releases the lock if it was already published.

    Because both sides take ``_guard`` around the flag-and-release, exactly one
    of them releases the lock no matter how the cancellation interleaves with
    the acquire, and correctness never depends on a done-callback running on a
    loop that may already be closed.

    Each call site uses its own instance; the wrapped lock is shared.
