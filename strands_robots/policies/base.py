"""Abstract base class for robot policies (VLA, motion planners, MPC, scripted).

The :class:`Policy` ABC is intentionally agnostic about *how* actions are
produced.  Built-in providers (`mock`, `groot`, `lerobot_local`) are VLA-style,
but the same interface is the right shape for:

* **Classical motion planners** - cuRobo, MoveIt2, OMPL, RRT*: take a goal
  pose and joint state, return a collision-free trajectory.
* **Model-predictive controllers** (MPC) - solve a finite-horizon optimal
  control problem each tick.
* **Scripted / pure-IK trajectories** - analytic IK followed by interpolation;
  zero learning involved.

Non-VLA implementations typically set :attr:`Policy.requires_images` to
``False`` to skip camera rendering (~10x throughput win at 500Hz) and read
their goal from the well-known ``**kwargs`` keys documented on
:meth:`Policy.get_actions` rather than parsing the natural-language
``instruction`` string.

See ``MockPolicy`` (``strands_robots/policies/mock.py``) for the canonical
non-VLA reference implementation.

    """Abstract base class for robot policies (VLA, motion planners, MPC, scripted).

    All policies implement async :meth:`get_actions`.  For convenience, a
    synchronous wrapper :meth:`get_actions_sync` is provided.

    The interface is general enough to cover both **VLA-style** providers
    (consume images + instruction, output joint targets) and **non-VLA**
    providers such as classical motion planners (cuRobo, MoveIt2),
    model-predictive controllers, and pure-IK / scripted trajectories.
    Non-VLA providers typically set :attr:`requires_images` to ``False``
    and read their goal from the well-known ``**kwargs`` keys documented
    on :meth:`get_actions`.

    All providers MUST honour the per-tick **action value convention**
    documented on :meth:`get_actions`: each action value is a python
    ``float`` (single-DOF) or ``list[float]`` (multi-DOF group), never a
    raw ``np.ndarray``, so downstream consumers handle every provider's
    output uniformly regardless of its internal compute backend. See
    ``MockPolicy`` for the canonical reference.

        Args:
            observation_dict: Robot observation (cameras + state).  VLA
                providers consume both ``observation.images.*`` and
                ``observation.state``.  Non-VLA providers typically
                consume ``observation.state`` only and set
                :attr:`requires_images` to ``False`` to skip camera
                rendering.
            instruction: Natural language instruction.  Required by the
                signature for VLA providers; non-VLA providers (motion
                planners, MPC, scripted) may ignore it and read the goal
                from ``**kwargs`` instead.
            **kwargs: Provider-specific parameters.  The following keys
                are **well-known** and SHOULD be honoured by non-VLA
                providers when present so callers don't have to JSON-encode
                goals into the ``instruction`` string:

                - ``target_pose: list[float]`` - Cartesian goal as
                  ``[x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz]`` (position in metres,
                  orientation as a unit quaternion in the robot base frame).
                - ``target_joints: dict[str, float]`` - joint-space goal
                  keyed by joint name; values are in radians (revolute) or
                  metres (prismatic).
                - ``world_update: dict | None`` - per-call world refresh
                  for collision-aware planners (e.g. point cloud / depth
                  image / mesh updates).  ``None`` means "reuse the world
                  configured at init time".

                Providers MUST ignore unknown ``**kwargs`` rather than
                raising, so callers can pass shared keys across providers.

        Returns:
            List of action dicts for robot execution.  Each dict maps a
            robot state key (joint/actuator name) to its **target value**
            for that tick.

            Values MUST be **JSON / python-native**: a python ``float`` for
            a single-DOF actuator, or a ``list[float]`` for a multi-DOF
            actuator group.  Implementations MUST NOT return raw
            ``np.ndarray`` objects -- coerce with ``.tolist()`` /
            ``float(...)`` before returning -- so downstream consumers can
            treat every provider's output uniformly (e.g. ``float(v)`` on a
            scalar, ``len(v)`` on a group) regardless of the policy's
            internal compute backend.

            The list length is the action-chunk horizon; consumers execute
            it at a fixed control rate (e.g. 50Hz).
