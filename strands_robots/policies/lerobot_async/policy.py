"""Remote lerobot inference over gRPC - client to a lerobot ``PolicyServer``.

:class:`LerobotAsyncPolicy` is a drop-in :class:`~strands_robots.policies.base.Policy`
that offloads inference to a remote lerobot ``PolicyServer`` (lerobot's native
async-inference gRPC transport, ``lerobot.async_inference.policy_server``).
Every :meth:`get_actions` call forwards the current observation to the server,
which runs the configured lerobot policy (ACT, SmolVLA, diffusion, pi0/pi0.5,
VQBeT, ...) on its own GPU and streams back an action chunk. Because it
satisfies the ``Policy`` ABC it works anywhere a local policy does:
``sim.run_policy(policy_provider="lerobot_async", ...)``,
``sim.eval_policy(...)``, or a hardware control loop that calls
:func:`~strands_robots.policies.create_policy`.

Unlike ``lerobot_local`` (which loads the checkpoint in-process, tying the
robot loop to the GPU that holds the weights), the async client keeps the robot
side light: it sends observations and applies returned actions while the
heavyweight model lives on a separate server. This mirrors lerobot's own
``robot_client`` / ``policy_server`` split and is the right shape for edge
robots (e.g. a Jetson) driven by a policy running on a datacentre GPU.

Start the server first (on the GPU host)::

    pip install 'lerobot[async]'
    python -m lerobot.async_inference.policy_server --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080

Then point the client at it::

    from strands_robots import create_policy

    policy = create_policy(
        "lerobot_async",
        server_address="gpu-box:8080",
        policy_type="act",
        pretrained_name_or_path="lerobot/act_so101",
    )
    # or via a smart string (server_address parsed from the URL):
    policy = create_policy(
        "grpc://gpu-box:8080",
        policy_type="act",
        pretrained_name_or_path="lerobot/act_so101",
    )

The client selects which checkpoint the server loads (via lerobot's
``SendPolicyInstructions`` handshake), so ``policy_type`` and
``pretrained_name_or_path`` are required. The connection is established lazily
on first :meth:`get_actions`, so constructing the policy does not require the
server to be up yet.

class LerobotAsyncPolicy(Policy):
    """Client-side policy that runs inference on a remote lerobot ``PolicyServer``.

    Args:
        server_address: Server address as ``host:port`` (gRPC). When given it
            takes precedence over ``host``/``port``. A ``grpc://`` scheme is
            stripped if present.
        host: Server host (used when ``server_address`` is not given).
        port: Server port (used when ``server_address`` is not given), an
            ``int`` in ``[1, 65535]``. A value outside the range is refused
            rather than interpolated into the gRPC target.
        policy_type: lerobot policy type the server should load (one of
            :data:`SUPPORTED_POLICY_TYPES`). Required.
        pretrained_name_or_path: HuggingFace model id or path the server loads.
            Required.
        device: Device string for **server-side** inference (e.g. ``"cuda"`` or
            ``"cpu"``). Defaults to ``"cuda"`` - the async provider exists to
            offload inference to a GPU host; override with ``device="cpu"`` for a
            CPU server.
        actions_per_chunk: Max number of actions the server returns per chunk.
            Must be a positive ``int``; it is also the default for
            ``actions_per_step``, so it is held to the same domain.
        actions_per_step: Number of actions the consumer executes from one chunk
            before re-querying (the :attr:`execution_horizon`). Defaults to
            ``actions_per_chunk`` so a chunked open-loop policy (ACT, diffusion)
            executes the whole chunk per network round-trip instead of paying a
            round-trip per control step. ``None`` selects that default; any
            other value must be a positive ``int``, since it bounds a slice of
            the returned chunk.
        connect_timeout: Seconds to wait for the gRPC ``Ready`` handshake. Only
            a positive finite number names a budget. gRPC turns a value that
            does not into ``DEADLINE_EXCEEDED``, which is what
            :meth:`_ensure_connected` catches to report "could not reach a
            lerobot PolicyServer ... Start one first" - so an unusable timeout
            is reported as an absent server. ``0`` is the worst of them: it
            succeeds against a server that answers instantly and fails against
            one that takes a second, so it is load-dependent rather than
            reproducible.
        request_timeout: Seconds to wait for each observation/action RPC. Same
            domain; it also bounds ``Ready`` on :meth:`reset`, where a failure
            is logged rather than raised.
        rename_map: Optional ``{robot_obs_key: model_feature_key}`` map forwarded
            to the server's ``RemotePolicyConfig.rename_map``. The server applies
            it as a ``RenameObservationsProcessorStep`` (renaming each matching
            observation key to its mapped name) before the policy sees the
            observation - the async analog of the ``lerobot_local`` provider's
            ``obs_rename``. Use it when the checkpoint expects camera/state keys
            that differ from the ones the robot exposes (e.g.
            ``{"observation.images.front": "observation.images.laptop"}``); keys
            not present in the map pass through unchanged.
        pad_short_actions: When a server chunk is NARROWER than the robot's
            actuator keys, command the unmatched actuators to ``0.0`` instead of
            omitting them. Defaults to False: an omitted actuator holds its
            position, whereas ``0.0`` is an absolute target on a LeRobot
            ``<motor>.pos`` follower, so padding TRAVELS those joints to zero.
            A boolean, checked rather than read by truthiness - it selects a
            posture rather than scaling a quantity, so a truthy spelling of off
            (``"false"``, ``"no"``, ``"0"``) is refused rather than selecting
            the padding posture the word asks to skip.

    Unrecognized kwargs are ignored (for forward-compatible ``policy_config``
    passthrough via :func:`~strands_robots.policies.create_policy`) but logged
    at WARNING, so a mistyped connection kwarg does not silently leave the
    client pointed at the default address.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``policy_type`` / ``pretrained_name_or_path`` are missing,
            ``policy_type`` is not server-supported, ``connect_timeout`` /
