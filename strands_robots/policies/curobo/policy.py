"""CuroboPolicy - in-process collision-aware motion planning via NVIDIA cuRobo.

The policy reads a goal from the well-known ``**kwargs`` keys defined in
issue #300 (``target_pose``, ``target_joints``, ``world_update``), forwards
the request to a :class:`MotionPlanner` instance running in the same
process, caches the resulting collision-free trajectory, and yields
``action_horizon``-sized chunks per ``get_actions`` call so the 50Hz
execution loop in :class:`~strands_robots.robot.Robot` can stream per-step
joint targets without re-planning.

The on-device cuRobo APIs were restructured between the ``0.7.x`` series
and the current ``main`` branch (issue #421). This module targets the
restructured ``main`` API:

* ``curobo.motion_planner.MotionPlanner`` (was ``curobo.wrap.reacher.motion_gen.MotionGen``)
* ``curobo.motion_planner.MotionPlannerCfg`` (was ``MotionGenConfig``)
* ``curobo.types.DeviceCfg`` (was ``curobo.types.base.TensorDeviceType``)
* ``curobo.types.JointState`` (was ``curobo.types.state.JointState``)
* ``curobo.types.Pose`` + ``curobo.types.GoalToolPose`` (planning now needs the latter)

The legacy ``WorldConfig`` is gone; the collision scene flows through
``MotionPlannerCfg.create(scene_model=...)`` at config-build time, and
per-call refreshes go through ``MotionPlanner.update_scene`` (or the
legacy ``update_world`` shim for stub planners in unit tests).

Construction mirrors the other non-VLA providers - no service mode, since
cuRobo is a CUDA library rather than a sidecar:

.. code-block:: python

    from strands_robots.policies import create_policy

    policy = create_policy(
        "curobo",                                  # alias: "cumotion"
        robot_config="franka.yml",
        world_config={"cuboid": {...}},            # fed to scene_model
        action_horizon=16,
    )

    actions = policy.get_actions_sync(
        observation_dict={"observation.state": [0.0] * 7},
        instruction="reach for the red block",     # ignored by planners
        target_pose=[0.5, 0.0, 0.4, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    )

The ``nvidia-curobo`` package on PyPI is an unrelated v0.1 squatter - the
real cuRobo is published only as source on GitHub. Users opt in by
installing it from source before constructing this policy::

    git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/curobo.git
    pip install -e ./curobo

The ``[curobo]`` extra in ``pyproject.toml`` is intentionally empty until
cuRobo publishes a real PyPI wheel. The policy module raises a clear
:class:`ImportError` (via :func:`require_optional`) on construction when
the ``curobo`` Python package is missing.

Stub seam: unit tests inject a fake planner via the ``motion_gen=`` kwarg
to avoid touching CUDA. The dispatch in :meth:`_plan_and_cache` prefers the
new ``plan_pose`` / ``plan_js`` entry points when the planner exposes
them, but falls back to the legacy ``plan_single`` / ``plan_single_js``
names so the stub-based test path keeps working without GPU.

class CuroboPolicy(Policy):
    """In-process cuRobo ``MotionPlanner`` wrapper.

    The policy is intentionally thin - all motion-planning state lives in
    the :class:`MotionPlanner` instance owned by this object. Because
    cuRobo runs on a CUDA device, this policy is **not** thread-safe across
    processes; callers that want fan-out should construct one
    ``CuroboPolicy`` per worker.

    Args:
        robot_config: Path to (or in-memory dict of) the cuRobo robot
            description YAML. cuRobo ships configs for many arms under
            ``curobo/content/configs/robot/``; for example ``"franka.yml"``
            or ``"ur5e.yml"``. May also be a pre-loaded dict (skips
            disk I/O - useful for tests and embedded deployments).
        world_config: Initial collision scene. Forwarded as the
            ``scene_model=`` kwarg to ``MotionPlannerCfg.create``. cuRobo
            accepts a dict with ``"cuboid"`` / ``"mesh"`` / ``"sphere"`` /
            ``"capsule"`` keys whose values are mappings from name to
            geometry params, or ``None`` for free-space planning.
            Per-call overrides flow through the ``world_update`` kwarg on
            :meth:`get_actions` and are forwarded to
            ``MotionPlanner.update_scene``.
        action_horizon: Number of waypoints to yield per call to
            :meth:`get_actions`. Matches the chunked-action contract used
            by the 50Hz execution loop in :class:`~strands_robots.robot.Robot`.
            Default 16 - same as :class:`~strands_robots.policies.groot.policy.Gr00tPolicy`'s
            inner-loop horizon.
        device_cfg: Optional cuRobo ``DeviceCfg`` controlling the device
            (e.g. ``torch.device('cuda:0')``) and dtype. When omitted, a
            ``DeviceCfg`` is constructed for ``cuda:0`` if CUDA is
            available, else ``cpu``. Passing a string (``"cuda:0"`` /
            ``"cpu"``) is also accepted; it is converted internally.
            Accepted under the legacy alias ``tensor_args=`` for
            backwards compatibility with code written against the
            ``0.7.x`` API; both kwargs map to the same parameter.
        motion_planner_kwargs: Optional extra kwargs forwarded to
            ``MotionPlannerCfg.create`` - e.g.
            ``{"interpolation_dt": 0.02, "use_cuda_graph": False}``.
            Reserved for advanced tuning; defaults are sensible.
            Accepted under the legacy alias ``motion_gen_kwargs=``.
        motion_gen: Pre-built ``MotionPlanner`` instance (kwarg name kept
            for backwards-compatibility with the ``0.7.x`` test-seam
            contract). When supplied, the policy skips its own
            ``MotionPlannerCfg.create`` + ``MotionPlanner(...)``
            construction. This is the seam unit tests use to inject a
            stub planner without a CUDA device. Production callers should
            leave this ``None`` and pass ``robot_config``.
        warmup: When ``True`` (default), call ``MotionPlanner.warmup()``
            after construction so the first ``get_actions`` call is not
            paying JIT-compile cost. Set ``False`` only for tests where
            warmup is expensive or undesirable.
        **kwargs: Forward-compatibility absorber for the smart-string
            resolution path. Per the #300 contract, providers MUST ignore
            unknown kwargs rather than raising.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If ``[curobo]`` extra is not installed and no
            pre-built ``motion_gen`` is supplied.
        ValueError: If ``action_horizon`` < 1, or both ``robot_config``
            and ``motion_gen`` are missing.
