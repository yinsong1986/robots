"""LeRobotDataset recorder bridge for strands-robots.

Wraps LeRobotDataset so that both real hardware (:mod:`strands_robots.robot`)
and simulation (:mod:`strands_robots.simulation`) can produce training-ready
datasets with
a single add_frame() call per control step.

Usage:
    recorder = DatasetRecorder.create(
        repo_id="user/my_dataset",
        fps=30,
        robot_features=robot.observation_features,
        action_features=robot.action_features,
        task="pick up the red cube",
    )
    # In control loop:
    recorder.add_frame(observation, action, task="pick up the red cube")
    # End of episode:
    recorder.save_episode()
    # Optionally:
    recorder.push_to_hub()

    LeRobot routes the codec differently across releases. Passing the wrong
    kwarg (or none) silently leaves the encoder on its built-in default, so the
    caller's ``vcodec`` is dropped without error - which is how an AV1 default
    sneaks back in even when the caller asked for H.264:

      * 0.5.0 / 0.5.1: a flat ``create/resume(..., vcodec=...)`` kwarg.
      * an interim build briefly exposed
        ``camera_encoder=VideoEncoderConfig(vcodec=...)``.
      * lerobot >= 0.6 (the supported range) moved the codec into
        ``rgb_encoder=RGBEncoderConfig(vcodec=...)``.

    Every one of these surfaces validates against LeRobot's codec-name allowlist
    (``{"h264", "hevc", "libsvtav1", "libaom-av1", "auto"} | HW_VIDEO_CODECS``)
    and rejects the ffmpeg library names ("libx264"/"libx265"). So the codec is
    normalized to its codec-name spelling once and routed onto whichever surface
    is present. The caller may pass either spelling ("h264" or "libx264"). An
    unknown codec raises loudly (LeRobot's own ValueError) rather than silently

    """Sync an on-disk LeRobotDataset into an HF Storage Bucket (Phase 1/2).

    Lifecycle-independent: needs only a finalized dataset directory on disk
    (``meta/`` present) and the ``hf`` CLI - no live
    :class:`DatasetRecorder`, no sim world. Covers syncing a dataset
    recorded earlier in the process, one recorded on hardware via
    ``lerobot-record``, or a daily re-sync of a directory that grew. Both
    :meth:`DatasetRecorder.sync_to_bucket` and the idle-path bucket sync in
    ``stop_recording`` delegate here so input validation and CLI
    orchestration exist exactly once.

    Mutable, Xet-deduplicated dump target for COLLECTION - avoids git-LFS
    history bloat of push_to_hub during recording. Daily re-sync uploads
    only changed chunks (content-defined chunking). Requires the ``hf`` CLI
    with the ``buckets``/``sync`` subcommands (``huggingface_hub>=1.5``)
    and ``hf auth login``.

    ``bucket`` and ``run_id`` are validated against an allowlist before any
    subprocess or URI interpolation: ``bucket`` must be ``"name"`` or
    ``"org/name"`` and ``run_id`` a single path segment, both restricted to
    ``[A-Za-z0-9._-]`` (no path traversal or shell metacharacters). This
    path is agent-reachable via ``stop_recording(bucket=, run_id=)``. A
    rejected value returns ``{"status": "error", ...}`` without running ``hf``.

    ``create``, ``private`` and ``delete`` select *postures* rather than
    scaling a quantity, so each is checked against
    :func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error` before the ``hf`` CLI is
    even located - the same domain the mesh provisioning entry points apply to
    their own capability flags. Read by truthiness they fail toward the
    permissive posture in *both* directions, because every non-empty string is
    truthy and every falsy non-boolean takes the other branch:
    ``delete="false"`` - the spelling an operator reaches for when opting out -
    appends ``--delete`` and mirror-deletes remote files absent locally, while
    ``private=0`` drops ``--private`` and creates the bucket *public*.

    The shard layout is already Xet/bucket-friendly at lerobot's defaults
    (100 MB data parquet / 200 MB video MP4 shards), and ``meta/`` MUST
    ship or downstream loses normalization stats.

    Args:
        root: Local dataset directory, ``str`` or ``Path`` (must contain
            ``meta/``).
        bucket: Bucket target, ``"name"`` or ``"org/name"``.
        run_id: Subpath inside the bucket; defaults to the dataset directory
            name (``Path(root).name``).
        create: Create the bucket first (pre-existing bucket is not an error).
            Must be a boolean.
        private: Create the bucket as private (only used with ``create=True``).
            Must be a boolean.
        delete: Forward ``--delete`` to ``hf sync`` (mirror semantics -
            remove remote files absent locally). Must be a boolean.

    Returns:
        ``{"status": "success", "bucket_uri": ...}`` or
        ``{"status": "error", "message": ...}``. Never raises on ``hf``
        failure; errors are surfaced in the result dict. A flag outside its
        domain is reported the same way, without locating or running the CLI.

    A LeRobot action column must hold the command that was issued at that step.
    When the dataset schema declares a column the frame's action dict does not
    carry, there is no such command, and every candidate placeholder is wrong:

    * ``0.0`` is itself a command wherever the action space is absolute
      position - a LeRobot ``<motor>.pos`` follower, a MuJoCo position actuator
      - so the joint TRAVELS to zero at servo speed on replay rather than
      staying where the un-commanded joint actually stayed.
    * A joint's measured position is in different units from a normalized or
      tendon-driven actuator's command, so substituting it moves those
      actuators too.
    * The command standing on the actuator cannot be read back, because the
      action-to-``ctrl`` mapping is deliberately not injective (a normalized
      open/close fraction and a raw tendon-unit command can share one ``ctrl``).

    So the frame is refused instead of persisted, which keeps the recorded
    action columns equal to what the policy issued and keeps ``replay_episode``
    a faithful round trip.

    ``required`` scopes the check to the columns the caller knows must come from
    this frame - typically the action keys of the robot being driven. Columns
    outside it (in a shared scene, the robots this rollout does not drive) are
    not this frame's to supply and are left alone.

    A required column is unrecordable whether the action dict omits the key or
    carries it as ``None``: neither is a command that was issued, and the two
    arrive from the same places - a policy that produced no value for a joint,
    a wire payload whose reading was ``null``, a dict built by zipping names

    ``camera_dims.get(camera, (video_height, video_width))`` once per declared

    cover. Both spellings are checked here on the same domain: a value refused
    through one and accepted through the other would let the same unusable
    shape into the schema by choosing where to write it.

    The shape is a declaration rather than a resize - the recorder rescales
    nothing - so it goes straight into the LeRobot feature as ``(3, height,
    width)`` and is not compared against a real frame until the first
    ``add_frame``. Three mistakes could not be honored as written and were
    reported nowhere near the parameter that caused them:

    * A key ``camera_keys`` does not declare is dropped by that ``.get``, so
      the camera it was meant for silently takes the global pair instead and
      the schema declares a shape that camera does not stream. This is the
      quiet one: nothing is logged, the dataset is created, and the mismatch
      surfaces later against ``add_frame``.
    * A component that is not a positive integer is written into the feature
      as given - ``(480, nan, 3)``, ``(480, '640', 3)`` - so the schema
      declares a shape no frame can match.
    * A value that is not a two-element sequence unpacks as a bare
      ``TypeError`` / ``ValueError``, and a non-mapping ``camera_dims`` as a
      bare ``AttributeError`` from the ``.get`` - none of which names this
      parameter.

    :func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_count_error` owns the component
    domain because a pixel count here is written into ``meta/info.json``: it
    has to be a true ``int``. An integral float lands in the schema as
    ``480.0``, and a ``numpy`` integer raises ``TypeError: Object of type
    int64 is not JSON serializable`` from the metadata write, so the wider
    whole-number domain would accept values this consumer refuses.

        Args:
            repo_id: HuggingFace dataset ID (e.g. "user/my_dataset")
            fps: Recording frame rate, as a positive whole number of frames per
                second. This is the rate the dataset is DECLARED at (it is
                written into ``meta/info.json`` and every frame timestamp is
                derived from it), not a rate anything is throttled to. The domain
                is the shared one every backend's ``start_recording`` applies to
                the ``fps`` it forwards here
                (:func:`~strands_robots.utils.positive_whole_number_error`), so
                the facade and this method cannot disagree about which rates are
                usable.
            robot_type: Robot type string (e.g. "so100", "panda")
            robot_features: Dict of observation feature names → types
                (from robot.observation_features or sim joint names)
            action_features: Dict of action feature names → types
            camera_keys: List of DISTINCT camera names (images become video
                features). One name per camera, in schema order; a single name
                still has to be a one-element list.
            camera_dims: Per-camera declared frame shape as
                ``{camera_key: (height, width)}``, keyed by the same names
                ``camera_keys`` declares. Note the order: ``(height, width)``,
                the reverse of the ``video_width`` / ``video_height`` pair it
                falls back to on this same call. Every backend that supplies it
                reads the camera's real render resolution, so a camera present
                here is declared at its own shape rather than the global one; a
                camera absent from the mapping (or ``None``, the default) takes
                ``(video_height, video_width)``.
                Every key has to be a name ``camera_keys`` declares: an entry
                keyed by anything else is never looked up, so that camera would
                be declared at the global pair instead of the shape given here.
                Each value is a two-element ``(height, width)`` of positive
                integers.
            video_width/video_height: Declared frame shape for every camera
                ``camera_dims`` does not cover. A declaration rather than a
                resize - the recorder rescales nothing - so a camera streaming
                another size is declared at a shape it does not have. This is why
                the backends pass ``camera_dims`` read from the live cameras
                instead of relying on this pair.
                Each is a positive integer - a pixel count is written into
                ``meta/info.json``, so an integral float would be declared as
                ``480.0`` and a ``numpy`` integer is not JSON-serializable.
            joint_names: List of DISTINCT joint names (alternative to
                robot_features for sim). These become the ``observation.state``
                column names, and add_frame reads each one out of the
                observation, so a name the observation does not carry records
                0.0 for the whole episode.
            action_names: Explicit action-column names. Use when the action
                space diverges from the joint names (e.g. actuator short-names
                from SimEngine.robot_action_keys, where a tendon gripper is an
                actuator with no matching joint). Falls back to joint_names.
            extra_state_specs: Optional vector state signals to append to the
                observation.state schema as per-component scalar columns, as
                ``(source_key, [component_suffixes])`` pairs. Each source key is
                read from the observation and flattened in order (e.g. a
                floating base's ``("base_quat", ["w","x","y","z"])`` adds four
                ``base_quat.*`` columns). Scalar joint/action fallbacks ignore
                these; add_frame reads the source keys, not the expanded names.
            task: Default task description
            root: Local directory for dataset storage. When omitted, the
                directory is resolved by
                :func:`~strands_robots.dataset_recorder.resolve_dataset_dir`
                and forwarded to ``LeRobotDataset.create`` explicitly, so the
                target ``overwrite`` inspects is the target the dataset is
                written to.
            use_videos: Encode camera frames as video (True) or keep as images.
                Selects a posture rather than scaling a quantity, so it must be a
                boolean (:func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error`) - the
                choice is written into the dataset schema as each camera's
                ``dtype`` and is fixed for the life of the dataset.
            vcodec: Video codec for the per-camera MP4 streams. Defaults to
                "h264" (H.264), which is universally decodable - including
                by OpenCV's VideoCapture / FFmpeg build, used by many
                downstream VLM video readers. Use "libsvtav1" (AV1) for
                smaller files in storage-constrained training pipelines;
                LeRobot read-back (torchcodec/pyav) handles AV1, but OpenCV
                wheels commonly cannot decode it and silently yield 0 frames.
            streaming_encoding: Stream-encode video during capture. Must be a
                boolean, on the same domain as ``use_videos``; it is forwarded to
                LeRobot's own boolean parameter.
            image_writer_threads: Threads for writing image frames
            video_backend: LeRobot video *decode* backend for read-back
                ("torchcodec" or "pyav"). Left as None by default so LeRobot
                picks its platform default; only forwarded when explicitly set.
                Encoder selection is controlled by ``vcodec`` (not this param).
            camera_key_map: Optional remap of observed camera stream names to the
                declared schema names (e.g. {"front_camera": "image",
                "wrist_camera": "wrist_image"}). Bare names or fully-qualified
                "observation.images.*" keys are accepted on either side. Use it
                when a policy declares image_keys that differ from the names the
                sim/hardware streams emit, otherwise those frames are dropped.
            overwrite: When the resolved dataset directory already exists,
                ``LeRobotDataset.create`` raises a bare ``FileExistsError`` (its
                ``mkdir`` uses ``exist_ok=False``). With ``overwrite=True`` the
                existing directory is removed first so a fresh dataset is
                created. With ``overwrite=False`` (default) an existing dataset
                (a directory containing ``meta/``) raises a clear
                ``FileExistsError`` naming ``overwrite=True`` (fresh) and
                :meth:`resume` (append) instead of the cryptic LeRobot error; an
                existing EMPTY directory (e.g. from ``tempfile.mkdtemp()``) is
                cleared so ``create`` does not dead-end on its own existence
                guard; a non-empty NON-dataset directory raises ``ValueError``
                rather than clobbering unrelated files.

                This flag is a confirmation gate in front of a delete, so it must
                be a boolean (:func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error`),
                on the same domain every backend's ``start_recording`` applies to
                the ``overwrite`` it forwards here. It is checked before the
                on-disk target is touched, so an unusable value cannot remove a
                dataset on the way to being reported.

        Raises:
            ValueError: ``camera_keys``, ``joint_names`` or ``action_names`` is
                not a list of distinct non-blank names (a bare string, a
                mapping, or a repeated name); or the declared camera frame shape
                cannot be honored - ``camera_dims`` is not a mapping, is keyed by
                a name ``camera_keys`` does not declare, or holds anything but a
                ``(height, width)`` pair of positive integers, or
                ``video_width`` / ``video_height`` is not a positive integer;
                or ``fps`` is not a positive whole number; or ``use_videos``,
                ``streaming_encoding`` or ``overwrite`` is not a boolean.
                Refused before the on-disk target is touched, so an
                ``overwrite=True`` call that is refused leaves an existing
                dataset intact.

        Unlike :meth:`create` (which calls ``LeRobotDataset.create`` and
        hard-fails with ``FileExistsError`` if the dataset dir already
        exists), this opens an on-disk dataset via ``LeRobotDataset.resume``
        so further ``add_frame``/``save_episode`` calls append new episodes.

        This is the multi-episode data-collection path: ``start_recording``
        with ``overwrite=False`` on an existing dataset routes here instead of
        crashing. The plain ``LeRobotDataset(repo_id, root=...)`` constructor
        returns a READ-ONLY dataset (``add_frame`` raises), so ``resume()`` is
        the only correct append entry point in LeRobot 0.5.2+.

        Feature schema is inherited from the existing dataset on disk - the
        caller's joint/camera layout must match what was originally recorded.

        Args:
            repo_id: HuggingFace dataset ID (same as the original recording).
            root: Local dataset directory. When omitted, the directory this
                ``repo_id`` resolves to
                (:func:`~strands_robots.dataset_recorder.resolve_dataset_dir`) -
                the same one :meth:`create` writes to, so the id that created a
                dataset reopens it. It is forwarded to LeRobot as an explicit
                root either way; LeRobot refuses an absent one, because the
                directory it derives for a writer would be the revision-safe Hub
                snapshot cache.
            task: Default task description for appended frames.
            vcodec: Video codec for the per-camera MP4 streams (default
                "h264"; routed into the version-appropriate encoder
                config). See create() for the H.264-vs-AV1 trade-off.
            streaming_encoding: Stream-encode video during capture. Must be a
                boolean, on the same domain :meth:`create` applies to the flag it
                forwards here (:func:`~strands_robots.utils.boolean_flag_error`).
            image_writer_threads: Threads for writing image frames.
            video_backend: LeRobot video *decode* backend for read-back
                ("torchcodec" or "pyav"); None uses LeRobot's platform default.
                Encoder selection is controlled by ``vcodec`` (not this param).
            camera_key_map: Optional remap of observed camera stream names to
                the declared schema names (see create()).

        Returns:
            A DatasetRecorder wrapping the resumed dataset.

        Raises:
            ValueError: ``streaming_encoding`` is not a boolean. Refused before
                the lerobot extra is probed, so the same caller mistake reports

        ValueError: If the episode index is not a usable non-negative whole
            number, is out of range, or the resolved episode has no frames.

    # could not actually honor:
    #
    # * ``bool`` passed it (``True < 0`` is False) and then indexed the
    #   episode table as an int, so ``episode=True`` resolved **episode 1**
    #   and returned it as a success - a different episode than any caller
    #   passing a flag could have meant.
    # * A non-integral or non-finite value passed it too and was blamed on
    #   the dataset after a full-length boundary scan ("Episode 2.5 has no
    #   frames"), naming the data rather than the index.
    # * A str/list/None reached the comparison itself and raised
    #   ``TypeError``, which is not the ``ValueError`` this function
    #   documents as its refusal channel.
    #
    # Shared with the ``replay_episode`` teleop knob rather than restated:
