"""Pure-RTPS (cyclonedds) hardware bridge - a real robot on ROS 2, no rclpy.

This is the rclpy-free sibling of
:class:`strands_robots.hardware_ros_bridge.HardwareRosBridge`. Both derive from
:class:`strands_robots.ros_telemetry.RosTelemetryBase` - the single source of
truth for the ROS 2 topic names and the inbound ``joint_command`` contract - so
they are byte-compatible on the wire by construction. ``HardwareRtpsBridge``
exposes the exact same ROS 2 topics for a physical
:class:`strands_robots.hardware_robot.Robot` - and to real ROS 2 nodes - but
speaks DDS/RTPS directly through the pip-installable ``cyclonedds`` binding
instead of a sourced ROS 2 distro:

* **publish** (outbound) - ``/<robot>/joint_states``
  (``sensor_msgs/msg/JointState``) and, per camera,
  ``/<robot>/<camera>/image_raw`` (``sensor_msgs/msg/Image``, ``rgb8``).
* **subscribe** (inbound) - ``/<robot>/joint_command``
  (``sensor_msgs/msg/JointState``) forwarded into
  ``robot.send_action({motor.pos: float})`` over a background poll thread, so an
  external ROS 2 stack can drive the physical arm. Full duplex, same contract as
  the rclpy bridge (shared via :class:`~strands_robots.ros_telemetry.RosTelemetryBase`).

Why this exists alongside ``HardwareRosBridge``: ``rclpy`` needs a *sourced ROS 2
distro* (apt / RoboStack / docker), which is heavy and version-pinned (Humble vs
Jazzy vs Rolling). ``cyclonedds`` is a single self-contained pip wheel that
speaks the RTPS wire protocol every ROS 2 distro shares, so this bridge runs on
a bare dev laptop or a minimal robot image with ``pip install
'strands-robots[ros2]'`` and nothing else. The trade-off is type coverage: RTPS
publishing needs a *local* IDL definition, so only the messages in
:mod:`strands_robots.rtps.idl` work (now ``geometry_msgs`` + the ``sensor_msgs``
``JointState``/``Image`` chain this bridge needs). The rclpy bridge keeps full
``sensor_msgs`` fidelity for anything outside the bundle.

Selection is the hardware ``Robot``'s job (``ros2_transport="rclpy"|"rtps"``);
this module only implements the RTPS path. Both bridges present an identical
``publish_joint_states`` / ``publish_image`` / ``shutdown`` surface so the
``Robot`` telemetry path is transport-agnostic.

    """Full-duplex hardware ROS 2 bridge over pure RTPS (cyclonedds, no rclpy).

    The rclpy-free sibling of
    :class:`~strands_robots.hardware_ros_bridge.HardwareRosBridge`. Both derive
    from :class:`~strands_robots.ros_telemetry.RosTelemetryBase`, so they share
    the topic names and the ``joint_command`` -> ``send_action`` contract and are
    wire-compatible by construction; they differ only in transport (cyclonedds
    RTPS vs rclpy) and in type coverage (bounded by the local IDL bundle).

    Args:
        robot: The hardware ``Robot`` to drive on inbound commands. When
            ``None``, no command surface is created (telemetry-only), mirroring
            the rclpy bridge's pure-publisher mode.
        domain_id: ROS 2 / DDS domain id to publish/subscribe on.
            Only an ``int`` in ``[0, 232]`` names a domain: RTPS derives its
            discovery ports from it, and 233 lands past the end of the port space.
        enable_commands: When True (default) and a ``robot`` is bound, subscribe
            to ``/<robot>/joint_command`` and drive the arm. Only a boolean names
            a posture: the value is checked, not read by truthiness, so
            ``"false"`` cannot select the surface it asks to close.
        command_robot_name: Topic namespace for the command topic; defaults to
            the bound robot's name (the namespace we publish ``joint_states``
            under).
        poll_period: Seconds between inbound command reads on the poll thread.
            Only a positive finite number paces a loop. It is the sole pacing
            of ``_poll_loop``, handed to ``Event.wait``, where ``0``, a
            negative and ``nan`` all return immediately - turning the thread
            into a busy-spin with no bound - and ``inf`` raises
            ``OverflowError`` out of it, killing the loop while the bridge
            reports a successful construction.
        joint_limits: Optional ``{"<motor>.pos": (min, max)}`` clamp ranges,
            keyed by the joint name as it arrives in ``joint_command`` - the
            same ``<motor>.pos`` names this bridge publishes in
            ``joint_states``, so a controller can echo them straight back. A
            key that names no commanded joint constrains nothing. Each bound
            must be a finite number - a non-finite one declares a range that
            admits nothing, so the bridge refuses it at construction rather than
            dropping every inbound command for that joint mid-run. When set,
            an inbound ``joint_command`` whose ANY commanded joint falls outside
            its declared range is rejected whole (no partial application), so a
            single out-of-range joint can never drive part of the arm.
        dds_security_config: Optional DDS Security credentials. Required keys
            (``identity_ca``, ``certificate``, ``private_key``, ``governance``,
            ``permissions``; ``permissions_ca`` optional) wire the participant's
            DDS Security plugins so the whole graph is authenticated and
            access-controlled. When ``enable_commands`` is in effect this (or
            the ``STRANDS_ROS2_BRIDGE_I_KNOW_THIS_IS_INSECURE=1`` opt-out) is
            REQUIRED - the bridge refuses to expose an arm-driving command
            surface on an unsecured DDS graph.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If ``cyclonedds`` (the ``[ros2]`` extra) is not installed.
        ValueError: If ``enable_commands`` is not a boolean, ``domain_id`` is
            outside ``[0, 232]`` or ``poll_period`` is not a positive finite
            number (all three checked before the ``cyclonedds`` probe, so the
            same caller mistake reports identically on an install without the
            extra), if ``joint_limits`` /
            ``dds_security_config`` is malformed, or if commands are enabled
